@SpotifyCares Premium &amp; when i️ have it on shuffle it turns off when the song is done and just plays in order and the repeat lights up but doesn’t repeat
@SpotifyCares doesn’t work and i even tried deleting the app
@SpotifyCares iphone 7+ and i have the most recent update for spotify
@SpotifyCares 2/2... and there is no way to manage Albums (recently added e.g.) in the App. It's a mess 😲 https://t.co/RlWuqllt8S
@SpotifyCares Yes, multiple times. No changes. I am Premium User an when @115890  send us users to Spotify there should be a bugfree running App 🤨
@SpotifyCares ok thx
@SpotifyCares using a MacBook Pro with OS X El Capitan and the latest Spotify update, and an iPhone 6S with the latest software/Spotify updates!
@SpotifyCares I tried it on web browser and it worked! 😊
@SpotifyCares Desktop app still not working, but I got to see the cool thing (Easter egg) so I’m ecstatic! 😊😊
@SpotifyCares 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Montreal, where the ad itself says I’m not allowed to get the deal.

We had another tweet exchange a few days ago when you emailed me the same offer.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the quick reply! I got it to work after un/reinstalling a few times, but I’m on MacOS High Sierra. Looks like version 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf? I’m not sure what the initial problem was, but again, it’s working now.
@SpotifyCares I doubt it :/ but thank you for replying!
@SpotifyCares I'm using my facebook account as a method to log in.
@SpotifyCares Spotify 8.4.24.871 Android version 7.0 device: a brand new Huawei mate 9 . I will look like an ass if it's a matter of just updates😊
@SpotifyCares Over all connection, I get this notification from the phone as for loving in and out I did a fresh install, no luck!
@SpotifyCares Hi. My @115888 playlists idea's status got changed + can't receive any votes. They sent me a link to a "similar idea", but it's closed.
@SpotifyCares What keywords besides "playlist", "playlists", + "song" would I use?
@SpotifyCares I feel like my idea has similar keywords as the one I was told to go to – that's closed and can no longer be voted on.
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I've dragged so many songs to the same playlists over + over. One of the aims of technology is to make everyday tasks easier, right? =]
@SpotifyCares AC/DC....
@SpotifyCares Well done, guys. 👍🏼 https://t.co/s9HZ9EqjEX
@SpotifyCares It’s on the mobile app
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/T85iGba29f
@SpotifyCares Okay! I did it! Thanks
@SpotifyCares What should I do in this cases? Thanks in advance! (2)
@SpotifyCares And this is why I’ll love Spotify forever and why you are my favorite music platform. Thank you! 🙏🏽💯❄️
@SpotifyCares I dunno what system you use that decides which part of the song it gonna play- I love Spotify, but maybe a custom clip option?
@SpotifyCares That stinks. Can you make it a feature, off by default, that I can enable?
@SpotifyCares I used to use that feature as an example of great UX. 😂🙈🙉🙊
@SpotifyCares Spotify 8.4.25.906 and iOS 11
@SpotifyCares No just on my phone since I installed iOS 11. Mostly on 3G/4g. It’s very random when it decides not to work.
@SpotifyCares Nothing, same problem seems to be happening to a lot of people.
@SpotifyCares Didn’t work
@SpotifyCares BTW I have a confirmation email to say my email address was updated, then got an email to say my subscription had been cancelled?
@SpotifyCares Doesn’t show in lock screen. Can’t adjust volume of phone isn’t unlocked also.
@SpotifyCares Works. Blame IOS update.
@SpotifyCares Yes I did. The dude even said thanks for watching now enjoy your 30 mins of ad free music.
@SpotifyCares Ok! Thanks. I will let you know if it happens again. Thanks for every thing! https://t.co/WWH8AKTJUk
@SpotifyCares No it didn't crash. I was cooking dinner and heard about 3 songs. Each song is about 2-3 mins. After the third song the ad played.
@SpotifyCares Help your boy out
@SpotifyCares I login with facebook (__email__) - but i think my email account for spotify is my old one (__email__)  that is now defunct. What can I do?
@SpotifyCares Fasho thank you for the help
@SpotifyCares I have now tried a different computer on a different network with a different browser (Edge) &amp; still can't push play.
@SpotifyCares Tried an incognito Chrome window.  No change.  Work has blocked https://t.co/JoK7ESpKMg in Firefox
@SpotifyCares Android 6.0.1 and Spotify version 8.4.25.771 armV7
@SpotifyCares With spotify open both on my computer and phone I added a local file to a playlist on my computer. ...
@SpotifyCares on my phone Spotify didn't show the song that was in the playlist but instead asked me to browse for music to add to my newly created...
@SpotifyCares playlist, I only want that one local file visible in the playlist.. It wasn't until I said download, that the song appeared.
@SpotifyCares It'd be helpful if it showed the song greyed out as it's not on the phone yet, and simply gave me the option to offline/download the song.
@SpotifyCares Checked the three dots and saw the download option and then my song appeared. It works.. but it feels hidden. Thank you for your interest :)
@SpotifyCares Added! - India 😊👍🏻
@SpotifyCares Shout! be in India soon ..
@SpotifyCares Here is this pop up that keeps coming up
@SpotifyCares Yes the music works fine no problem. Just the lock screen functionality has completely disappeared
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.3 and the Spotify version is 8.4.25
@SpotifyCares I have logged in to multiple devices as well. All iPhones with iOS 11 updates. Same problem
@SpotifyCares Then after about 5 hours it glitches again
@SpotifyCares Thanks. If you want to see the finest release notes known to man, check out the Argos app's release history. They add brand value!
@SpotifyCares And is that causing the other issue where nothing will play on sonos thru Spotify app?
@SpotifyCares They aren’t locally imported… We just imported her iTunes playlist in Spotify so it found identical songs. Is that why they are greyed out?
@SpotifyCares @118117 Why does it say “can’t play this right now” and why are playlist songs greyes out (originally imported from iTunes)
@SpotifyCares Done , thanks! ;) #launchInIndiaSoon 🤣😂🤣
@SpotifyCares @115888
Just checked , still unavailable
@SpotifyCares Nevermind. I just googled it 😬
@SpotifyCares Well seeing as it didn't work anyway I can't see this a bad thing. Hopefully you will get it fixed soon. Seeing as it's been &gt;6 months
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares does this work on roku yet?
@SpotifyCares Ok, thanks.
@SpotifyCares You DO care 😭
@SpotifyCares :(( okay. thank you anyways
@SpotifyCares Thank you. Will keep an eye on that.
@SpotifyCares First it was quiet, then a ring of people closed in on me from the shadows, chanting Top 100 hits. Before I knew it, I woke in a cold sweat.
@SpotifyCares I uninstalled another program just to be sure it wasn't a problem with my computer but it worked fine.
@SpotifyCares I tried uninstalling the program in safe mode but it still doesn't work
@SpotifyCares No worries. It was just this that happened. 

https://t.co/Wy1mUOr1VK
@SpotifyCares I have! I’m able to play the playlist on my computer but it won’t sync to my phone and this comes up when I go into the playlist on my phone https://t.co/YI495wlYlX
@SpotifyCares I really hope it comes to the west soon. Thanks for answering.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/MUE1aQFaeH And country is Germany but a friend mine is in the US and only sees those 2 songs as well in the latest album.
@SpotifyCares @120860 This is very urgent and should be fast-tracked
@SpotifyCares Thanks, Spot ver-1.0.66.478.g1296534d it's on a macbook pro Yosemite ver 10.10.5.
@SpotifyCares Still not there :(
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/GvE0JBxILu
@SpotifyCares Every song, and no
@SpotifyCares Latest version, it only freezes when I play from the side menu on my ps4
@SpotifyCares Splendid
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your help. Had to entirely reset my phone (it died when I logged out of Spotify) That fixed the problem though. Cheers!
@SpotifyCares Android V7.0, Samsung S7 Edge, Spotify V8.4.25.771armV7. Bluetooth controls work fine on all other media apps, play/pause dont work on sptfy
@SpotifyCares So why let non premium customers even select them.? Pointless.
@SpotifyCares It's cool dw I thought it was a funny glitch. 😂😂 restarted the app and its all working now
@SpotifyCares Why spotify not allowed in Saudi Arabia?????????? And when it will be allowed?? I waited for long time!!
@SpotifyCares You better not be late! https://t.co/hPTQBBUdAM
@SpotifyCares Hey! Here's what I'm currently using. No problem on my iPhone though, only on my iMac. Cheers! https://t.co/iGnEwvu03h
@SpotifyCares Yep, tried several times, didn't fix :(
@SpotifyCares I’m using the newest version of iOS and the 8.4.25 version of spotify
@SpotifyCares So can I not go back to the normal spotify cause I’m not really to fond of this version?
@SpotifyCares Iphone 8 on ios11.1 and latest Spotify version - as available on app Store
@SpotifyCares Can’t tell straight away, need to see the music behaviour for a bit. Will get back as soon as i know :)
@SpotifyCares Thank you! :)
@SpotifyCares Like what ?
@SpotifyCares already tried with an other computer and for the password dont need it im loggin with my facebook account !
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/40GhuixFya
@SpotifyCares Galaxy S7 Edge
Android 7.0
Spotify 8.4.25.771
@SpotifyCares That i did ages ago.
@SpotifyCares Sorted now 👍🏿 turns out when someone uses it on my laptop it changes my phone too 🙈
@SpotifyCares I said I fixed it.thanks.
@SpotifyCares Worked a treat, thanks
@SpotifyCares can you please add a feature to only view releases from artist you follow.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I really hope you add the option to only view new releases from artist that we follow.
@SpotifyCares done!
@SpotifyCares The “time capsule” playlist is suggesting music that I haven’t listened to in 15 years, so I am curious as to how you even know this info.
@SpotifyCares How about you guys just make it happen as it will be an increased revenue stream and it's the right thing to do?
@SpotifyCares iphone 6s and i’m not sure but i’d assume the lastest update?
@SpotifyCares Here it is 
https://t.co/waO48RizBo
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/tGbLK4aErF This is what Breezeblocks should sound like! Just to make your job easier.
@SpotifyCares Just closing and reopening the app fixes it, but it’s intermittent
@SpotifyCares Checked, none of these apply - unless an *automatic* update deleted them and switched off the download option?
@SpotifyCares Got back in to find mobile downloaded playlist deleted and download setting switched off.
@SpotifyCares Reinstalling the app did fix some issues but I still have problems with artist info in locked mode and control center
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares Also: App sometimes suddenly just stops playing music altogether, related to that issues w/ Bluetooth devices (music also stops)
@SpotifyCares Many things: app is unstable overall, impossible to adjust volume in locked mode, no artist info available in locked mode &amp; control center
@SpotifyCares when trying to join a family "4 - Oops something went wrong, please try again."
@SpotifyCares Work laptop(i7 8gb) Windows 10, chrome
@SpotifyCares No error messages, the music just cuts out every 10-15 seconds.
@SpotifyCares Will do!
@SpotifyCares Spotify think I get wrong password, so I try to reset my password with myusername: linalthf, but I forgot what e-mail I used. Can u help me?
@SpotifyCares i have a bigger issue. songs would stop playing after a few seconds but continues after half a min or so, i cant pause music bc it just---
@SpotifyCares --keeps on playing &amp; spotify doesnt seem to detect that im online when i have perfect connection. sony f3216 android 7.0 spotify v8.4.24.871
@SpotifyCares Can you help me
@SpotifyCares Hi I signed in with Facebook
@SpotifyCares But can I put my account number in so my payment can still comes out
@SpotifyCares If I my card is cancelled
@SpotifyCares Can my payment still come out
@SpotifyCares Ooh! Thank you.
@SpotifyCares And thanks for sharing the link 😊
@SpotifyCares Nothing is solved if I send you the link. Your service is still leaking customer informations.
@SpotifyCares Windows 7, 15GB Ram, Spotify version 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares I had already done it...before..!
@SpotifyCares S/O for the comeback guys! 👌🏿
@SpotifyCares Finally got it working thanks
@SpotifyCares There are no error messages. Ill try to play it and it just wont and this isnt the first time. Im just wondering why I cant play it https://t.co/mbTJuQJj25
@SpotifyCares Sure! It’s a concept album, so order is important. ☺️ Thanks! https://t.co/LRdM0G5fmo
@SpotifyCares i’m trying to transfer local files from my macbook air with macOS sierra version 10.12.6 to my iphone 7 with ios 11 and spotify version 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares Hey! So I can't renew my acc because it says that my balance isn't enough, the fact's mine's more than enough :(
@SpotifyCares I have a Samsung S7, Android 7.0 and the latest version of the Spotify app
@SpotifyCares My laptop runs on Windows 10 and my Spotify is the latest update
@SpotifyCares I tried that multiple times
@SpotifyCares Yes, I even reset their locations to see if that would work but it didn't
@SpotifyCares Yes they are. And I've tried the other networks available to me
@SpotifyCares Hello, I've tried to tell my problem from the website https://t.co/CjnbQxnYv1 but until now I can't get my premium account back, I still can't logged in to my account :( @115888 @118266 @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares On iphone app in folder wich i create on PC and put inside some playlist i dont have play button like in PC app
Tnaks
@SpotifyCares Thanks! You've really nailed the recommendation aspect 💚. I think library organization is an area all streaming services can improve.
@SpotifyCares Thx but I tried this many times :( It says “you previously logged in to Spotify with FB” and I don’t know how to change that 😕
@SpotifyCares I tried disconnecting this supposedly other Spotify acct from FB but I have not been able to
@SpotifyCares Please do! X
@SpotifyCares It says the case is closed?
@SpotifyCares That’s annoying. 🙃
@SpotifyCares excuses over excuses i just want the albums 😔
@SpotifyCares It is fairly clear how it should work, but I don't listen to jam bands. So P Groove, Jerry Garcia and Flaming Lips in the same week is odd.
@SpotifyCares Just putting a lil drama here hahahah dont mind me. Keep doing u guys! Hearts from the PH!
@SpotifyCares Hate to burst ur bubble @SpotifyCares but https://t.co/A8WeUwU4kt
@SpotifyCares I remember the reply from your side finally being: we know this is an issue, working on it or something. But it’s a bug so should be fixed..
@SpotifyCares I'm sorry, I tried that last time to no avail. Can you instead first verify for me that this is indeed a feature that is supposed to work ?
@SpotifyCares Hello #Spotify. 26 Sept I reported a bug, wha'ts the status ? I still can't drag playing #songs to #playlists :((((
 isn't this a big issue?
@SpotifyCares Tried that, totes doesn't work. When I play from mobile OR desktop, I can't drag the currently playing song...
@SpotifyCares Mac / OSX 10.11 + 1.0.63.617.g5aca9a2a and IOS 11 + spotify 8.4.18.632 https://t.co/mdW5xnhS3T
@SpotifyCares You guys have the best support team!! I'll DM you now :)
@SpotifyCares Just followed the reinstall instructions provided and when I tried logging in I got Error Code: 2  again. Suggestions? https://t.co/5nzL1LdUlk
@SpotifyCares Before messing with the settings I was getting error code: 2

I am able to use the web player, but miss my friend feed
@SpotifyCares no, it's working as intended cutting from the last manson album to an endless stream of "suggested songs" of bland shitty metal #thanks
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your information 🙏🏼
@SpotifyCares I think it works on faster speeds? Idk the search bar has been kind of wonky lately
@SpotifyCares I've tried using 2 and for both cases search is kind of on-and-off. Usually off when I sleep my computer and go back to spotify
@SpotifyCares Well technically it works. It only errors when you hit the search button
@SpotifyCares Version 10.10.5 OSX Yoesmite. No changes to system. I own 3 Spotify accounts and no matter which is open, after a short while, it just goes
@SpotifyCares 1972mazz is one of them. It doesnt have anything to do with the account. its the application on a macbook
@SpotifyCares No updates. I have downloaded it 6 times in a year. A lot of my fellow Mac users have the same issue.
@SpotifyCares The link you sent talks about songs being removed. Im talking about the entire Spotify application going. See the picture. Always happening. https://t.co/TV4qAM8eZA
@SpotifyCares I didn't say I wasn't enjoying it!
@SpotifyCares but when it's been 9 years since Spotify was launched
@SpotifyCares This worked for 1 day and the release date is gone and only the year is shown.
@SpotifyCares Still hasn’t corrected itseltf !
@SpotifyCares I’m in the US and I don’t have a link to the album because it’s not streaming. :(
@SpotifyCares Yesssssssss man I love you guys.
Screw Apple Music, it blows.
@SpotifyCares Hey! So if I have a playlist with say 20 songs and 15 artists, it plays the songs by each artist grouped together on shuffle (so 4 by the
@SpotifyCares Same person) or a song followed by the remix of the same song. So frustrating I want random shuffle! It's the most recent app update on iOS
@SpotifyCares Yeah it's been doing it for a while but I made a new playlist to test fully. So it's not just a new update? Do I try redownloading the app?😊
@SpotifyCares you've got mail.
@SpotifyCares Obviously they don't work. found workaround: Sort albums/artists by "name" then go back to "songs" &amp; shuffle again. THIS IS NOT IMPROVEMENT!
@SpotifyCares Ok but are you bringing it back or
@SpotifyCares spotify pls :(
@SpotifyCares Never crashed, so idk
@SpotifyCares Yes, the whole City Bank ad played and I waited and then heard one song and then got multiple afterwards.
@SpotifyCares @127972 Spotify on iPhone or web has all of the functionality (Spotify/user created playlists, daily mixes, etc) and a nice UI, Roku app has nothing
@SpotifyCares @127972 This isn't a tech support issue, it's a design/effort/resources issue.  It's a bad user experience for your service is all.
@SpotifyCares @127972 For example, the Spotify app on Xbox one is great, wish I was able to access something similar on roku
@SpotifyCares Seems to me u label music with a sexual preference, which is odd, and that music in turn with a user. Feels very inappropriate and not pc.
@SpotifyCares the discover page was basically showing Discover Weekly, Release Radar, New Releases For You and then duplicating the Overview page list
@SpotifyCares Hi, it was the windows app. After a couple goes at force exiting the app and relaunching it, the lists eventually populated as normal.
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much! Listen, I'm a huge spotify fan. Keep up the amazing work friends
@SpotifyCares And I’m using the desktop version on my laptop
@SpotifyCares HP EliteBook. Intel Core i7. Windows 10. https://t.co/PItTf0kvIq
@SpotifyCares hmmmm seems like there's demand for it.
@SpotifyCares Hi ! It’s an iMac retina 5k late 2015. MacOs high Sierra v 10.13  spotify version 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares Al necessary updates done. Empty cache done... web based spotify is faster. But I think my Spotify Premium deserves to be fast.
@SpotifyCares Always been like that. Restarting the app helps for a few minutes.
@SpotifyCares Ok. Just to be sure, I'll listen to some country music, unless Spotify thinks I am into cowboys and indians next week. Lol.
@SpotifyCares Can I use Paypal linked to my UK bank account?
@SpotifyCares Nah, I have most my songs offline on my phone and it works perfectly perfect. And also nah, even Adobe Photoshop doesn't crash my laptop.
@SpotifyCares I just did. It still crashes.
@SpotifyCares I’ve tried both of those and neither worked
@SpotifyCares ios version 8.4.25 and ios 11.0.3
@SpotifyCares iphone 7plus and ive got the newest version of spotify
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s Plus, iOS 10.3.2, and the most recently updated version of Spotify
@SpotifyCares That did work, thank you so much!
@SpotifyCares It was not a question, more of letting you know that your documentation page is not working.
@SpotifyCares Is there a way to increase the limit? I am a huge music fan and like to save and  browse my albums. This seems like a weird restriction.
@SpotifyCares I voted but it seems pretty clear there's no intention to change this. Why is this limit in place? I want to browse an album collection.
@SpotifyCares It's not reasonable, though. None of your competitors have a limit, and the users who don't reach it would never notice if it was increased
@SpotifyCares Is there a limit on the number of playlists I can have?
@SpotifyCares Will check and let you know. Thanks :)
@SpotifyCares How can i see this while on desktop mode?
@SpotifyCares Ok, thank you :)
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Brett Eldredge: ‘Wanna Be that Song’ was removed from my library &amp; is no longer available to download
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/IXCq1LN5c0
@SpotifyCares This was the seventh song suggested to me that was already on my playlist, and the fifth that had already played https://t.co/6kupfgnFoJ
@SpotifyCares The playlist contains music from the last seven years. The amount of artists is not the issue. There's something wrong in the coding
@SpotifyCares PC, Windows 10 - I guess the version is "1.0.66.478.g1296534d" (that's all I could find in the about spotify bit)
@SpotifyCares Tried that but none of it works. Album is Modal Soul by Nujabes in mp3 format. I can see the files in spotify but they just wont play.
@SpotifyCares Can you specify when you will update us ? https://t.co/4cwusQseh7 was last updated 1 year ago by Spotify?
@SpotifyCares Please change your name SpotifyDoesntCare #SpotifyExlipicitFilter 5 years and counting
@SpotifyCares I don't get it am I supposed  to have the app available now?.
Because I still can't download it
Please explain how this works
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the support thoe
@SpotifyCares much appreciated!
@SpotifyCares Ah okay.  Thanks.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/7o1265L4mk I cannot even find it on the app anymore.  I'm set to United States.
@SpotifyCares Doesn't really speak to my question. I asked why it is like that. It doesn't make sense to have a cap on a music library. #disappointed
@SpotifyCares That makes ZERO sense. What does me having more songs in my library have to do with other people having less songs? Still no answer to why?
@SpotifyCares Neither that post nor you have answered the question why's there a limit. "Because it's better" isn't a response. Why is it better?
@SpotifyCares A post made in 2012, Spotify responds in 2016, and now its 2017.Doesnt seem to be on your radar or a good site for feedback.
@SpotifyCares Thank ya for passing it along.
@SpotifyCares @129240 On another matter, I have Spotify Premium.  I’m spending February in Florida. Will I be able to access all my playlists online there?
@SpotifyCares Aha! It came through. Thanks, found it.
@SpotifyCares From the Chrome console. 
Though I’ve had similar issues in Firefox too. https://t.co/WkaGOR8PWL
@SpotifyCares Everything is up to date. Clearing the cache  reduced the length of the freezes, but they still happen. Getting about 60-100 logged errors per freeze. 
Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Nope that doesn’t help. It happens on multiple devices.
@SpotifyCares The 2nd track follows the 1st on album &amp; has similar title but should sound like comical screaming backed w/ circus music &amp; be much shorter
@SpotifyCares 8.0.0 / latest.  It's only for some albums.  Same album I tested plays with correct volume in Groove.
@SpotifyCares Multiple pairs of headphones, which are otherwise fine i.e. When using Groove
@SpotifyCares Foo fighters in Atalanta on 4/28. Possibly part of the credit card on file with Spotify...
@SpotifyCares I need to switch my account to a student account.
@SpotifyCares In the middle of down with the sickness.
@SpotifyCares So no, I haven't logged into the web player with incognito or private browsing
@SpotifyCares Will do
@SpotifyCares The US,, I'm sure they aren't available, they're pretty rare, to even buy
@SpotifyCares Hah Okk thank u
@SpotifyCares Thanks tell them my life depends on this show 🆘
@SpotifyCares Sure! This is the song link, and I’m in the US. https://t.co/uGIDKCKlH1 Glad I could help
@SpotifyCares Tried reaching out to them in many different ways with no response :/
@SpotifyCares Hopefully:(
@SpotifyCares Thanks guys:)
@SpotifyCares Just did !
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares Hi there! I mean this whole screen. It always opens by default and promotes these big name artists I absolutely never listen to, as you know from my listening habits. https://t.co/e8sWcYCywg
@SpotifyCares Thank you very much.
@SpotifyCares I am the owner of a family Spotify account.  There are four of us who live in the same house. Only two can activate....
@SpotifyCares What about my downloaded albums?
@SpotifyCares So 20 minutes after reinstallation data is synced but all my artists now say '0 songs'.
@SpotifyCares Most of the time it's after an update sometimes it just happens randomly.
@SpotifyCares Saved playlists
@SpotifyCares What does right-click mean on a phone?
@SpotifyCares What do you mean by “DM”?
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/iLZuNEpki5
@SpotifyCares But it has so far
@SpotifyCares I'd rather you just said "we have no intention of doing this" than the glib "Yeh we'll look at it" comments you have been spouting for a year or more
@SpotifyCares Any news???!
@SpotifyCares but it's been requested for years now, what's the point?
@SpotifyCares apparently, you care, so how about it?
@SpotifyCares Thanks for getting back to me, it seems to have sorted itself out, for now. Will get back to you if the issue pops up again!
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I didn't know this was a thing!
@SpotifyCares Seems to have done the trick. Thanks for the quick replies.
@SpotifyCares Tried this. Couldn't find the com.Spotify file anywhere on my phone. Reinstalled  and now it just won't open at all. https://t.co/U2KYQuBoeg
@SpotifyCares Samsung S6
Android 7.0
Spotify version 8.4.28.875
@SpotifyCares Tracks constantly skipping, jumping. Doesn't matter whether I'm on 4G, WiFi, whether tracks are downloaded or streamed. About a month now.
@SpotifyCares I sent you guys a dm.  I seriously need cflarification in here
@SpotifyCares I know, I'm a long time user... And it's breaking more every day. Please start supporting it, that's what I'm asking. Or just release an update now and then.
@SpotifyCares Well, thanks. Guess that's the best I can expect. Have a good day!
@SpotifyCares I'll gladly translate it: @115888, please start developing for Linux again...
@SpotifyCares hello - iphone7, ios 11.0.3, spotify 8.4.28.1104, 

it is exactly the same issue raised on your help desk by someone else here - https://t.co/fpjMnrEIMN
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Also adding some kind of store for merch so y'all can make a cut? Idk
@SpotifyCares Yes, it works, thank you!
@SpotifyCares i have only Chrome... others are not allowed at office T_T
@SpotifyCares music stream stops playing (on mac) says that another device is playing.. would like to know which one… (I have sonos, ipad, iphone etc etc) so I can disconnect the other source
@SpotifyCares I wanted you to know that I don’t pay for music.
@SpotifyCares Literally you overslept, the world is your playground. Spotlight on your music. I cant find the most music on Spotify. It Only got mainstream music Which i hate, because they are money hungry untalanted people. You are the most powerful app yet you don’t have much music.
@SpotifyCares Only just saw this reply. It was both on my phone (android nexus 5x) and laptop (macbook pro). Tried multiple networks too. But it seems to have resolved itself now. Thanks anyway!
@SpotifyCares I'm using Samsung J5 year 2015 and 8.4.28.875 armV7 for the Spotify version. Thank you ;)
@SpotifyCares I use 4G, never using Spotify over WiFi. I haven't tried on other Android devices. btw, I have updated the new version but still the same.
@SpotifyCares uhm i don't think so, this is my 2nd time purchasing premium in Android device. The first time there was Behind Lyrics 🤔🤔
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares ah, I guess it’s because I’ve revived n old account and had deleted the main one I had been using for years? Which reminds me, I had lots of playlists on the old account (leonclowes) - is there any way of retrieving these please? Thanks
@SpotifyCares But 3,333 songs is practically a third of my library and I want to download my whole library on my phone😭😭
@SpotifyCares Oh I know how to fix it - I just keep forgetting to switch the bloody device
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/XkUnV04egl https://t.co/L1wzKscozh
@SpotifyCares Sure! It’s https://t.co/6j3tycHC8F

PS.: pay attention because this song is also in other albuns of the same band, so remember to check if the title is correct in all of them! 💕
@SpotifyCares Okay but why isn’t it possible yet? I supported it with my vote already. The request by Liam on the community page was written in 2013
@SpotifyCares I have solved the problem. Spotify Artists would not work with Safari browser - works fine with Google Chome....
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/8wxCqCAb9A If that’s true then there is zero chance to make a living out of online streaming!
@SpotifyCares No this is not a hiccup - you have altered spotify and made it inaccessible to blind people!  Fix it! Thanking you in advance - read my message carefully to comprehend.
@SpotifyCares Not me, but my bestie. She's trying to make acc on spotify because they said that something went wrong
@SpotifyCares Hi started the 99p for 3months deal and I’m not on premium when I sign in?
@SpotifyCares I haven’t had premium before but can’t get it as it say unable to do via a virgin phone.
@SpotifyCares never mind! you're good
@SpotifyCares Hey! It's resolved now - just looks as though there was a bloop in my ISP when connecting to Spotify. Btw, is that a template message in LSW/Lithium Response?
@SpotifyCares It doesn't appear to make a difference on wi-fi or data. I don't use it on another device so no idea, sorry
@SpotifyCares 😭😭😭😂😂😂😂
@SpotifyCares De/install fixed it
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/xHTHfDErKN
@SpotifyCares It doesn’t let me click the filter bar when editing my playlist and there is no option in the (...) next to the song that says delete
@SpotifyCares I can type in it as long as I’m not in edit. Here is a picture of all the options from the (...) https://t.co/IctP8gy0X5
@SpotifyCares OK so far, but it did take a few tracks before it packed in last time. I'll keep an eye and let you know.
@SpotifyCares Yes, the @13281 app is the latest version.
@SpotifyCares It really doesn't, does it?! Android 7.0, Spotify 8.4.25.771 armV7. And so far as I know it is, but I'll check. (Here's an example of the Spotify issue alone.) https://t.co/pVbeC6UlQO
@SpotifyCares I just noticed this, you guys are funny. I love it! Haha.
@SpotifyCares Hi! It's not that having the ads themselves is unbearable, it is the ads themselves that will drive up ur premium sales #amazingwork
@SpotifyCares Game changer. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s with the most current operating system and Spotify version with a premium family account
@SpotifyCares 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares some songs in the playlists become unsaved
@SpotifyCares Nope. You want this: https://t.co/WCORfzxV4g
But you've got this: https://t.co/8ONGp2DpNg
@SpotifyCares Yeah, right here: https://t.co/vuyVHtpZdF
Thanks, guys, gals and gender non-conforming individuals.
@SpotifyCares Fantastic response timeframe! Many suns ago I had a Spotify account. I got an apple device for work and am back to establish a Spotify monthly subscription and it’s difficult.
@SpotifyCares it's a shame! It's not even like I need an "inbox" just being able to send a song through spotify would be so cool. But anyway! Thanks so much for replying &lt;3 X
@SpotifyCares Samsung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930T), Android version 7.0, Spotify version: 8.49.289 armV7
@SpotifyCares That definitely worked it out, thank you!!
@SpotifyCares Android version 7.0 on Galaxy S8, app version... https://t.co/70HTRPfj9p
@SpotifyCares I can't find that option. I've checked and my Sonos app is up to date. I've removed and then re authorised Spotify as a music service. All no joy.
@SpotifyCares Just checked, worked straight away on my daughter's iPhone using linked family Spotify account.
@SpotifyCares Hi, after the latest android update I can't control my Sonos through the Spotify app, but works fine from the Sonos app. The speaker is shown in the list, but nothing happens. I have already tried restarting everything, reconnecting to WiFi, and reinstalled the app, but no joy.
@SpotifyCares And, on top of that, bc you reset the password and didn't give it to me, I can't go in an command a reset.
@SpotifyCares Ok thx for thr explanation!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for response! The app says that music is playing, but no sound comes out. I have to restart to make it work again.
@SpotifyCares Tried it. Still happening. To recreate: play a track on Spotify app. While playing, open Twitter and start a video or GIF. Then go back to Spotify app and hit play. You'll see it "playing" but with no audio.
@SpotifyCares iPhone X, running iOS 11.2, listening over wired headphones
@SpotifyCares Both 😅
@SpotifyCares I first noticed it when I upgraded from my iPhone 7+ to the X. Is this a known issue?
@SpotifyCares I got chat and got it taken care of easily. Thanks for the support.
@SpotifyCares Here you go. Thank you so much for the speedy reply. You guys rock! https://t.co/MbkND3Wviy
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately it’s giving me an error when I try to uninstall as well /:
@SpotifyCares Yes, completely removed and reinstalled both apps
@SpotifyCares Love u
@SpotifyCares Thanks for replying @SpotifyCares. That article basically says that you've made it worse. Without the functionality to see my saved artists/albums/playlists then this app is useless. In my opinion, It needs an overhaul and comparable functionality to every other form of your app.
@SpotifyCares I know it can be difficult to keep up with the many iterations of your beautiful service, thankful there are many ways to use it. Thanks for your consideration and time today!!! @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares OK, I did all those steps, fingers crossed and Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I know, but your UI is saying that I’m at 1k+ of 4k+ downloads. It seems like it should say 1k+ of 3,333. ;)
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8plus, iOS 11.1.2, 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares Both songs and albums. The only downloaded material are the three Spotify playlists: New Music Friday, Discover Weekly, and Release Radar.
@SpotifyCares I use Firefox Quantum on Mac OS Sierra version 10.12.6 on a late 2009 iMac desktop. Fairly often Spotify just won't let me play any music. I have to totally close Spotify and re-login for it to work again. Sometimes a browser reset is also necessary. Thanks for looking into this.
@SpotifyCares Dry by edit I meant move tracks around to any order through phone. Not just random. I want to rearrange playlists.
@SpotifyCares Missing all together 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
@SpotifyCares Spotify version 8.4.29.29 armv7
Android version 6.0.1
@SpotifyCares hi! it’s set to the UK :)
@SpotifyCares Okay, thanks. Hopefully it won't happen again!
@SpotifyCares Still waiting for @5568's mixtape Karma to be up tho
@SpotifyCares Aight guys appreciate it
@SpotifyCares Do you guys know when @21409 mixtape Benny On Steroids is gonna be up tho
@SpotifyCares Aight no doubt thanks
@SpotifyCares Thanks guys it's up
@SpotifyCares Hi there! Those songs are not found on Spotify 😭😢
@SpotifyCares Is this for every song and artists or only the artists? I see only a karaoke song. I want the whole song it's a remember to are grandmother
@SpotifyCares What I’m asking is, how can I find the other, older versions (e.g. if I didn’t already have them saved). istr there used to be an “x more release(s)” link at the bottom of the track listing page for an album, but in this case I can’t find it. 2/2
@SpotifyCares Ah OK, that explains why I can’t find it! :)
@SpotifyCares My Spotify computer app has legit said "offline" for 4 months and every attempt that customer service has attempted has failed miserably.
@SpotifyCares I have a lot with the UX of the spotify app, but twitter has not enough space to document all flaws ... Your Content is great, the UX is atleast medium 😞
@SpotifyCares Thanks guys, sorted
@SpotifyCares All tracks. Windows 7, Chrome web player
@SpotifyCares Look at this https://t.co/krVqJPAEPC
@SpotifyCares Actually.. this is at least the third time this has happened during a work day... so I'm gonna need at least 3 free months
@SpotifyCares This isn't the first time Spotify pooped out mid day 😪
@SpotifyCares @137960
@SpotifyCares I’ll try it. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I had no problems the rest of the day when listening in the incognito window.
@SpotifyCares i'm using the web player on the website on windows 7 64 bit. i also tried logging out and back in and that did nothing.
@SpotifyCares i wasn't using the app, i was using the web player. but i will try the app and see what's up there and see if it's still not working on there.
@SpotifyCares the app works. so i'll just use that. that is weird though, that glitch i had never happened before. anyways, thanks for your help! have a good day!
@SpotifyCares I already tried a different browser and now I just tried incognito. No difference. Still frozen.
@SpotifyCares A day later, computer turned off overnight, and it's still frozen on the same song. The player isn't responding to any clicks.
@SpotifyCares Yeah, it kind of went away by itself. I got a bunch of TOO MANY REDIRECT errors when I was trying to log in, but it resolved itself after an hour or so. Maybe you had some temporary, localized server issues. Anyway, I'm happy again. 😊
@SpotifyCares Version 8.4.29.289 on Android Oreo 8.0.0
@SpotifyCares Nope, no difference. Pixel XL 2
@SpotifyCares Nope. Still the same
@SpotifyCares Seems to be affected by my Bluetooth headphones. No issues if I play using my phone's speakers
@SpotifyCares It's definitely to do with your equaliser. Sound only dips when I use it. Music sounds flat without it though.
@SpotifyCares @138958 Why not give something back to old and faithful customers as well...
@SpotifyCares I know. I've been a premium subscriber for so many years and have never gotten any deal. It's the way cookie crumbles but don't I just think it's wrong.
@SpotifyCares I'm sure I'm not the only one. ;)
@SpotifyCares It was an iPod gen4 but also tried my phone which is and iPhone 6 on the latest iOS and it was doing the same thing. Just played half a song then stopped
@SpotifyCares Will do. I’m off out though now so I’ll do it when I’m back and let you know
@SpotifyCares it's a UK account
@SpotifyCares Windows 10, Google Chrome.
@SpotifyCares Still does not help.
@SpotifyCares @139555 For me, as soon as I logged in it would log me out (in Chrome). I switched to Firefox and was able to log in. Makes me think something is cached weird.
@SpotifyCares I'm not sure what happened, but shortly after I sent my last tweet, I tried logging in in Firefox and it worked. Then when I went back to Chrome it worked again there too, so it's all good now.
@SpotifyCares For the browser: the only thing that's happening is I will click on the play button and nothing will play. And I'll try to pick different songs or playlists and it won't work. Sometimes if I refresh it will work again but often I just have to wait a while for it to work.
@SpotifyCares appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.
@SpotifyCares Done! Thanks
@SpotifyCares Not on my desktop right now. But it's Windows 10. And app tries to start and then shuts down after seconds.
@SpotifyCares Hey DF, Chrome V62 on a Mac. I didn't write down the ads, but three consecutive ads disabled the volume (stays grey on hover), and when music resumed playing the volume became active again (green and interactive on hover).
@SpotifyCares Open Spotify then toggle to another app (using the 3D panel switch button thing - don't know what it's called). Also happens during notifications
@SpotifyCares Chrome web player on Windows 10. Playlist loads but won’t play music (says it is), won’t let me change playlists, won’t let me select other songs. Basically unresponsive to everything.
@SpotifyCares Ok! Thanks
@SpotifyCares Sweet! Thanks for the info!! :)
@SpotifyCares I've reinstalled the app and am now getting the attached error code when I try to log in. https://t.co/F7W4O0rQkZ
@SpotifyCares I have no other internet connection accessible right now, and it worked just fine over the same connection last night. I also took a look at my firewall and I don't have anything there that would be blocking it.  :\
@SpotifyCares Issue persists on mobile… iPhone 7+ running iOS 11.1.2. https://t.co/Y60OdeFwXE
@SpotifyCares Not to my knowledge! I'm running Spotify version 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3 on a late 2011 MacBook Pro running High Sierra.
@SpotifyCares Hi! My app is showing as offline. I originally thought it was an issue with my ISP, however everything else seems to be working. https://t.co/lBISKMty2y
@SpotifyCares English (English)
@SpotifyCares Ok. I’ll give that a go.
@SpotifyCares Hey. Just managed to try this and it resulted in the same behaviour. 
Spotify audio muted. 
When gif stops, Spotify didn’t kick back in. 
Spotify shows as still playing, but no audio. 
Have to kill and restart Spotify.
@SpotifyCares Hi there @SpotifyCares - anyone there today?
@SpotifyCares I'm on my home computer now and I'm experiencing the same problem- I'm entering my new credit card details and then click Continue, the spinning icon starts spinning, and the page just hangs there waiting for something to happen but nothing ever does
@SpotifyCares Tks! But I can’t found the list anywhere, and I try to restore it but I couldn’t find either.. there’s is anyway to set it up again?
@SpotifyCares Hi I'm on a Samsung S7 Edge, Android 7.0 and Spotify version 8.4.28.875 armV7. Thanks
@SpotifyCares No I'm not - will do. Thanks :)
@SpotifyCares cheers! still loving everything else
@SpotifyCares I haven't made an account yet. I want to check that when I become a student I won't have to continue paying full price.
@SpotifyCares Why can’t I delete a song from a radio lost all together? The dislike button isn’t there for all songs.
@SpotifyCares Thank you, But I listened to every song of Taylor Swifts waiting for the album and now I know the lyrics to every song on every album. Anyway.....so basically I just have to keep checking the new releases every friday
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your time
@SpotifyCares omg even better https://t.co/IOTQIWr3vW
@SpotifyCares omg that was so terrible 
but gr8
i hate u 
but also love u
 i feel so https://t.co/DaY0pCo9St
@SpotifyCares if u couldnt tell idk how u link stuff so i had to resort to paint but im fairly sure u wouldnt have been able 2 tell unless i told u like i just did xoxoxoxx
@SpotifyCares Done ✅ thank u 😁
@SpotifyCares Thank u again 😍 https://t.co/5Nh0hXwjKz
@SpotifyCares I mean, "Your Spotify app needs updating" Is kinda unsatisfying since this happens every few weeks
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Nothing against the support personnel. But the 10k limit is ridiculous, esp. given your competitions' far more generous limits, coupled with the (otherwise excellent) "discovery" aspect of Spotify.
@SpotifyCares Yeah. I've already replied to that thread, months ago - and the thread was started in 2014. So it's nice that Spotify 'hears us', but… it doesn't feel like you're doing anything about it. Rather frustrating.
@SpotifyCares I want A "mix-button" so the songs mix in your playlist. It's very tuff to change all the song by your shelf. It takes a long time.
@SpotifyCares I mean that all the songs mixes when you press the "mix-Burton". It takes A long time to move them around by you Shelf.
@SpotifyCares I want A Button you press and then all the songs on your playlist change places randomly.
@SpotifyCares It did work but it says I already had an offer like that even tho my account is brand new.
@SpotifyCares is there really no workaround for this? I wouldn't mind putting some time into making this work, but Spotify just has so little use for me if this can't be done...
@SpotifyCares I think Im missing the point. That article doesn’t say anything about iTunes or how to move songs added through iTunes to playlists :-(
@SpotifyCares yes I already did that before I asked my initial question (about importing smart playlists).
@SpotifyCares okay, thanks. How do I cancel my subscription? Is this possible each month, or is it per year?
@SpotifyCares That worked, tack så mycket !
@SpotifyCares Hi, different browser worked, thanks :-) ! Next hurdle - sorry - sent an invitation to him and he got a mail with a code and an accept button / pagelink. After browsig to the link, he needs to logon, but with which account ? Mine ? He does not have one of his own.
@SpotifyCares Your advertisement says “get 3 months for 9kr” but why do I get the message that I’m not eligible for the offer - advertised with no conditions - for me it’s 99kr from first month.
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares Thanks JK. It's saying incorrect username and password. I've not changed my password at all though. I can only assume my account has been compromised in some way?
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately I'm pretty certain that I no longer have access to the email account joined to this account. What can you do to help? I can provide my mobile number and proof of SMS confirming payment? I can also confirm any personal info such as DOB etc if you store this?
@SpotifyCares my contract comes with two years free spotify subscription, every month £9.99 is added to my bill and i have to keep reapplying...
@SpotifyCares the supscription via the internet and vodaphone said it’s something i have to solve with spotify as they can’t help me
@SpotifyCares It's just not optimised for the aspect ratio of the phone
@SpotifyCares Android 7.1.1 Spotify 8.4.28.875
@SpotifyCares Also I’ve deleted app and reinstalled but it’s still happening.
@SpotifyCares Have just tried that to no avail. It’s only happened since the last update on 17 November.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s. iOS version 11.1.2
@SpotifyCares All devices say I have a free access but I do have a premium account. By the way why am I charged 12,99 € and not 9,99 as advertised?
@SpotifyCares @141629 Put tell me you love me @115888
@SpotifyCares Ok, thanks for the help.
@SpotifyCares Version 8.4 Samsung Galaxy S8
@SpotifyCares I was merely asking if the 3 months for 9 dkk also applies to loyal subscribers.
@SpotifyCares Yes. Sadly @115888 seems to value non-users higher than customers ☹️
@SpotifyCares @115888 This track is on Humid Teenage Mediocrity (a Collection of Early Joj Recordings 1992-1996)
@SpotifyCares This was the desktop app!
@SpotifyCares Thanks a lot, I'll compile the form now c:
@SpotifyCares Your plan is to DM with me to talk about fixing a defect that has affected every customer for seven or more years, and this is going to cause it to get fixed?
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your quick response, but I've already chatted with a Spotify operator and he was able to solve the problem! 😉
Good service btw 👍
@SpotifyCares Great! Thanks a lot! (:
@SpotifyCares Hey! I wasn’t asking for myself but for someone I’m trying to hook up to Spotify as I am. (: So if they go Premium now will they have it until the end of Dec or for 3 full months?
@SpotifyCares Great, thx for the help.
@SpotifyCares Inspector Clouseau, at your service! 💎
@SpotifyCares Question: what's the actual price of the chirstmas/black Friday deal? Is it £9.99 or £0.99? Just slightly confused haha x https://t.co/d33FDSKh5P
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the useful information 👍😁
@SpotifyCares @142351 What about changing our usernames? Which team is working on that?
@SpotifyCares Randomly generated and assigned numbers is just ridiculous. I don’t even want to use Amazon Music but you’re giving me no choice.
@SpotifyCares You’ve been passing the feedback on now for 4yrs but thanks anyway.
@SpotifyCares Yes. So many times. What’s the point of paying for premium if you’re just going to keep deleting my music?
@SpotifyCares may I just also ask if the 9 peso premium thing is only applicable to card?
@SpotifyCares can't access your so called 9 peso premium using card or load
@SpotifyCares Just dm'd you
@SpotifyCares My account spotify is premium, why my account spotify have a advertaising? why? Please respon
@SpotifyCares Please cek DM thanks you 😊🙏
@SpotifyCares Thanks you for you respon and replay my problem admin 😊
@SpotifyCares Did you remove the 1986 The Fly soundtrack? =(
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.2.2, Spotify 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares I've submitted several support requests over the years, usually the only remedy is resyncing thousands of songs after you guys finally fix whatever bug is blocking me from using the features I pay for. This is a waste of my time (and your bandwidth).
@SpotifyCares Could you try adding more an error message when a file wont play? Could you try building in a way to resymcing specific files?
@SpotifyCares I can't perform those steps, I am away from the machine I synced the indicated files from, because I assumed the in app indicator was accurate. I assumed to my own peril of course.
@SpotifyCares but, it already has unlimited votes
@SpotifyCares I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 my phone keeps telling my to update it but it doesn't or anything. I think it might be he problem
@SpotifyCares @142706 I eraed all datanuninstalled reinstalled but i dant log back in
@SpotifyCares Ok thank you
@SpotifyCares YES! Thank you so much &lt;3
@SpotifyCares It then says that I can only use Spotify abroad for 14 days but I've been using it in Australia since July absolutely fine
@SpotifyCares I’m sorry but what do you guys mean??? I just posted the song I was listening to??
@SpotifyCares It’s still up though? https://t.co/TdGx6RGAsr
@SpotifyCares But this still doesn't explain it.  I can find it through the web player and from Google which takes me to the album on the app, so the album is there.  However, if I look for the album by searching in the app for it, it's not.  That tells me the search function is different. ?
@SpotifyCares Cool - so less dislike &amp; more I never wanna hear from men who have sexually assaulted teenagers.  It would be a great thing for y'all to do in the name of supporting the reduction of violence in entertainment.
@SpotifyCares Also - it seems y'all considered this and decided against it.  That's super disappointing.
https://t.co/wTaMWUWerI
@SpotifyCares Nope. No crash. Just the same 3 ads on repeat.
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares Linkin Park and Jay Z
@SpotifyCares So are you not able to request songs that don't contain explicit content for children. I want my son to listen to the album but I can't when it has explicit content.
@SpotifyCares Given the fact the email associated with my account was already out to the public on a popular website before this conversation began, I'd say it doesn't matter. Also, what does it matter that I DM it now? You've already got the email.
@SpotifyCares Who said it was actually mine though?
@SpotifyCares they fixed it, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Even you guys are better at responding to people than @ATVIAssist
@SpotifyCares sure! gone by ionnalee. it was just released a few hours ago, so maybe thats the issue
@SpotifyCares i checked again today and its working now!
@SpotifyCares im on desktop and it just won't let me select the song to play. its a bit grey and doesn't do anything when i click it
@SpotifyCares Sure, thank you
@SpotifyCares @143967 how to get the promo 129php for 3months?
@SpotifyCares Great thank you!!:)
@SpotifyCares Of course! Thanks for being so attentive!
@SpotifyCares More, to be exact I have 9,285 songs
@SpotifyCares @144795 Well that’s bullshit
I wanna buy the P9 membership using my paypal
@SpotifyCares i have PHP 25 on paypal pls stop asking for my credit card info even tho i dont have one
@SpotifyCares I had a 5 min ad of walmart and old navy for their black friday sale , no joke back and forth walmart and old navy
@SpotifyCares Thank youuuu
@SpotifyCares Here’s another example https://t.co/ld2Gm7NYXA
@SpotifyCares You guys are the best!
@SpotifyCares @144805 please and how can we compensate can you give me some playlist help
@SpotifyCares Yeah yeah yeah but what if I only use spotify on one device? If you have a million audiophiles with over 3333 songs on their devices shouldnt you cater to them instead of mucking around with justin bieber?
@SpotifyCares That fixed It! ☺
@SpotifyCares I'm on Samsung galaxy 7 and but I just realized I'm using an older version. I'll update and see if that fixes it
@SpotifyCares Thanks for replying (and so quickly!). In case your development team wonders why, it’s because running an iPhone in Japanese is the only way to get names in Contacts to sort by kanji rather than just putting everything under #
@SpotifyCares Australia
@SpotifyCares MacOS, on the latest version
@SpotifyCares Yay all fixed, thank you :)
@SpotifyCares Hello i havent received your DM
@SpotifyCares sure it is windows 10 Home and app version is 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3 (Windows Store version)
@SpotifyCares i am so sorry i am out for coffee i will do it asap
@SpotifyCares I'll lose the downloaded data if I do that way :') I'll try it later, thanks! :)
@SpotifyCares I mean for when I log out 😂 thanks!
@SpotifyCares Sorry for the late reply! I've restarted my phone yesterday and the volume is fine now. What a simple fix lol oops 😅 Thanks so much!!
@SpotifyCares Sent the Dm
@SpotifyCares Meh, too much effort. I'll just deal with it. 😊
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks
I'm tried to pay by my card 
How rules for it?
@SpotifyCares Seems to be the radio having issues playing non Christmas Classics and I can't share em. Christmas Hits and Christmas Classics.
@SpotifyCares Viewing album shows the Christmas songs but I'd honestly prefer to use radio. Any chance it'll get fixed?
@SpotifyCares Well I'm hoping before Christmas! 😜 👍
@SpotifyCares Tried logging-in and out a few times. Does it regardless of amount of cached tracks. iPhone 6 and SE. iOS 9 to 11.
@SpotifyCares Loyalty never gets rewarded maybe I’ll cancel mine.......
@SpotifyCares if i have to put all of these artists in one more time i may freak... get yr sh't together https://t.co/R9fhivSkTt
@SpotifyCares Even remotely relate. Your alogrthims are either screwed, or you assume jazz/blues/folk is related to country. Insulting just thinking about it
@SpotifyCares The one thing I'd really, really, really like is the ability to drop a song from the mix. That way I can enjoy the rest on repeat shuffle. Would be a nice feature
@SpotifyCares @147827 Its so unfair!! The promo is for VISA cardholders only. 😑 How about us? Stop broadcasting incomplete details!
@SpotifyCares Please explain how can I avail
@SpotifyCares @147836 Cool, thank you 😀
@SpotifyCares I've worked it out now thank you anyway
@SpotifyCares Can I do it on the app though or? Thank you
@SpotifyCares I don’t make any offline playlists so it’s just happening to my downloaded albums. Happens every week or so.
@SpotifyCares yes. if i close the app it will stop the music, snapchat will stop it, and text messages will also stop.
@SpotifyCares im on iphone 7, and IOS11 and version 8.4.28
@SpotifyCares The info are the same from months, probably you aren't interested what more than 2.000 iOS spotify users think..
@SpotifyCares I purchase the 3 months for 9 pesos spotify premium , its not working https://t.co/ErnWIbZpfe
@SpotifyCares But is it available outside Québec ? In other provinces ?
@SpotifyCares Thanks, will it be available before the end of the year?
@SpotifyCares It happened to my downloaded albums. I thought that it was because of lack of authorization to use the phone's storage. But even after I've give the authorization, downloaded songs don't stay synced.
@SpotifyCares Hi guys I got sorted earlier thanks
@SpotifyCares I'm finally able to stream! Thanks for the reply!
@SpotifyCares I tried using my debit card but I still can't register 😩 https://t.co/7OnYwzhrJJ

@SpotifyCares @115888 @3493 @8513 If you can't offer the deal to people in Quebec, the ad for the deal should not be shown to people in Quebec.. On Twitter and in the app.
@SpotifyCares Sweet. I e-mailed The swedish support two weeks ago but they haven't answered. I keep getting logged out from my account and can't log in without reinstalling the app. This deletes all my downloaded playlists. What can I do?
@SpotifyCares yes, that's correct but in this particular album https://t.co/67N4QTSxlo appears misspeled band name https://t.co/9QbXJG8ApX
@SpotifyCares Thank you :) It's Trinidad and Tobago
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you for checking.
@SpotifyCares PLEASE REPLY TO MY DM!!
@SpotifyCares oh nevermind guys, panic came too quick! it's all sorted out now.
@SpotifyCares OMG YOU GUYS REPLIED WOW HAHAHAHHAHAHA i'll have to check ithe other offer again but i'm hoping for the latter 😉
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 , iOS 10.3.3 , Spotify 8.4.28
@SpotifyCares I created a new account of my own, to then purchase family for new devices and my household... Problem is I used sign up with facebook and it used the facebook email that existed (4years ago) but was change and deleted from facebook.... Heelp?
@SpotifyCares Hello, thank you for the reply, but I've actually got it sorted now! Sorry for raising the alarm prematurely! Have a good weekend!
@SpotifyCares Hi. The problem (pixelisation after minimize under Windows 7) even with version 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3 is still there. 😟
@SpotifyCares No, this does not help. The problem is still there.
@SpotifyCares Those of us that have had premium for years now, do we not get any special offers? :)
@SpotifyCares Create account)
@SpotifyCares Firstly i got this https://t.co/quy9FB21dY
@SpotifyCares And  already 30 min this https://t.co/CMrvRNus3U
@SpotifyCares Okay, I sign up and how I can change country?  Cause now I have Germany and everything is in german
@SpotifyCares Wasn’t aware of the 10k limit - that’s a shame. Any plans to extend anywhere near Apple music’s 100k? https://t.co/dkHiBFamF7
@SpotifyCares Hello! I’m not sure how to do this without a manual count on my current setup? Only using app, not desktop version...
@SpotifyCares Qdas
__email__
@SpotifyCares Hi! In a PC through the web player :D Will there be an option to organize them later?
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I'll do it!
@SpotifyCares What if there's no choices for debit??
@SpotifyCares and this is the other choices https://t.co/XVTDWqgFA1
@SpotifyCares what account? In spotify?
@SpotifyCares I’m about to cancel my account if you cannot resolve this. I have done what you requested and it is still occurring.
@SpotifyCares Yep, hacked. Your anti fraud systems are shit. A couple of accounts added to my family account. Can you please check what else has been done to my account?
@SpotifyCares The email I used to purchase was __email__. I unfortunately do not have the receipt any longer!
@SpotifyCares Germany!
@SpotifyCares The other playlists stay synced except songs often get removed from my device and need to redownload... which I assume is to give me the latest version, but really how often does a song need to actually refresh?
@SpotifyCares Thnx JP I will go personally to the Berlin Offices to get an email where I can contact them.
@SpotifyCares Wondering why Loreens new cd Ride are not available on for spotify france?we have 2 singles and the ep from this summer.i have had the same problem with new music from other swedish artists before..
@SpotifyCares Just for information it is there today!!😁
@SpotifyCares No. It has been this way for the past month if not a little longer.
@SpotifyCares That did not resolve the issue my home macbook pro. My work desktop mac doesn't even have a spotify cache folder in the library directory.
@SpotifyCares I can't even get the web player to work on my macbook pro. Aside from myself and coworkers it appears there are others in your community posting about the same thing https://t.co/OaUm3mg5cC
@SpotifyCares Not sure on that but it's been going on for 1-2 months.
@SpotifyCares Sure. Both my macbook pro and mac desktop experience the same issue with that. 

High Sierra 10.13.1
@SpotifyCares I can’t get the album 😭
@SpotifyCares Chrome on PC. But...of course now that I got a hold of you, it plays! LOL Thanks for reaching out, you guys.
@SpotifyCares No, it doesn't. I've tried multiple browsers too.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/JNZ11gjkjC
@SpotifyCares Why i should DM you?  You need to explain why this is happen......
@SpotifyCares Has the system been having problems because I have received multiple receipts saying I paid and my bank statement also says it went through
@SpotifyCares It's still saying the same thing
@SpotifyCares I'm on Google chrome. And I originally tried to download spotify on my phone (which is an Android) but it still wouldn't let me create an account
@SpotifyCares 8.4.27.895
@SpotifyCares notifications still stop my music so i have to force quit the app and play the song back over.
@SpotifyCares no, i turned off the notifs sounds because i thought that was the problem! snapchat is one of the main ones. sometimes the music just shuts off out of nowhere. im the only one that uses my spotify account
@SpotifyCares Very nice! I am more into calm (yoga like) music. And I would love if you could make a playlist for me!
@SpotifyCares Thanks 😀
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/0biUGZHKla
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/e5CjQjlWy2
@SpotifyCares I reinstalled the app and it is all good, thank you though guys, have a great one
@SpotifyCares I did that! There's no option to change the zip code at all, only phone number, carrier, and type of phone. I tried on my laptop and on my iPhone. Neither let me change the zip code
@SpotifyCares It seemed like it resolved it for now, but I'll keep checking
@SpotifyCares Ok i would love to see it!
@SpotifyCares yes ive known this, but whats the progress on the current situation, of getting Tool on Spotify.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for getting back to me. My question is - when you "shuffle" a playlist is it truly random?  For at least the past year it feels like the same songs keep coming up even though there are over 2k on the playlist.
@SpotifyCares Preciate ya 🙏
@SpotifyCares Anytime before the three months end? If I wish not to continue?
@SpotifyCares This is a workaround for when the device is on 4g and something on the home network is playing. Having the devices imonbthe same network would still cause this problem. Why would the Android Spotify app even force other apps to pause?!
@SpotifyCares @154719 That's … not a solution.
@SpotifyCares No. Completely new android device and also had the same behaviour on my previous one. If I listen to di.fm on my phone in one room and use Google Home (or another android device) to start a song, Spotify pops up on the first device and pauses whatever other audio is playing.
@SpotifyCares ok, thank you for the info, I'll get it done asap.
@SpotifyCares RCA Voyager 2 tablet (Android )
@SpotifyCares I've done that when it started acting up and it didn't work
@SpotifyCares Wifi
@SpotifyCares I know there's a limit you nerds, get rid of it.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!
@SpotifyCares It's working again now. For the record: laptop; Windows7; 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf that was installed today. Hopefully not too many users are/were affected.
@SpotifyCares :( :( :(
@SpotifyCares Android
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/L9KsssD9Ms
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/7KCjeXZjoW
@SpotifyCares IPhone 7. Very odd? Consistent tonight. As per your request deleted old version &amp; updated to new one?? Same issue. Maybe local to the phone but bloody awful to sort out playlist when pissed ✋🏼✋🏼👀👀
@SpotifyCares Done a turn on/off. Done a reinstall, same problem? https://t.co/t2ZjWNesor
@SpotifyCares Thanks. That seems to have done it.
@SpotifyCares it is necessary to clear the cache
@SpotifyCares Hi! I am using Spotify v1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf on macOS Sierra 10.12.6 - it happens when I click on an artist and select a specific album to play a specific song from (it doesn't play at all).
@SpotifyCares It seems that it works again now. I was previously streaming music while connected to the university network with an ethernet cable. Now outside. Thanks for the quick reply guys 🙂
@SpotifyCares All music, but only on the album pages. Spotify version in my original tweet
@SpotifyCares @155919 im having also the same problem
@SpotifyCares Didn't you have one? I can't seem to find the settings now tho
@SpotifyCares I don't see it! https://t.co/dtbDvfULQH
@SpotifyCares What's the best one?
@SpotifyCares Why not?
@SpotifyCares Nope, doesn’t work 😔 I’m able to log on with my Facebook, but after that it just gives the same error.
@SpotifyCares OSX High Sierra -&gt; Spotify 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf -&gt; Onkyo NR-656. Once I set Spotify to send to "This computer", scrobbling seems to work as Last.fm reports "Scrobbling now" then. Does not happen when Onkyo is receiving the sound.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, OS 11.1.1
@SpotifyCares After the update.
@SpotifyCares No. You misunderstood. How does it look in my tweet? I see this: https://t.co/DZxuprl5Kc
@SpotifyCares Hey thanks for the reply! iOS 11.1.2, Spotify 8.4.28.1104

Looks like this is the breaking point for the UI (everything below that size seems fine but I didn’t do a thorough QA): https://t.co/asCDrMIHKd
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately that didn’t fix the issue
@SpotifyCares Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still an issue. Reproduced this issue on other phones with accessible/larger text turned on. Seems like there’s a height limit and affects songs in a list with longer names. Definitely something for the design team to look at.
@SpotifyCares A good example is the This Is: Bob Dylan playlist. 

Normal and increased text size: https://t.co/wchd4QmC1I
@SpotifyCares @156307 @SpotifyCares, This is clearly not an account issue. It's a design issue. This is a bug that needs needs to be address so the app will be accessible to users who need larger type.
@SpotifyCares It’s the latest version of each 👍
@SpotifyCares It’s solved the queue issue, but not the playlist issue...
@SpotifyCares USA
@SpotifyCares I'm using Spotify v8.4.28.875 armv7 on my stock Android 7.1 phone.
@SpotifyCares Heard people got the app working as it should after doing a factory reset, but that's a tedious thing to do. Got any alternatives?
@SpotifyCares Believe me. I tried doing that. Multiple times. Doesn't solve the problem.
@SpotifyCares It now seems to be working fine. Always the way....!
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately it was on mobile and isn’t showing up in the recently played or play queue history. This is so extreme, but is there a way to pull history from certain time periods? Like 11-22-2017 between and 5:00-8:00EST?
@SpotifyCares None of the song titles are with the right songs. Fiction is titled as Back to You, Freeze is titled as Virus.
@SpotifyCares I have, yes
@SpotifyCares What do I do?? https://t.co/knTHvjU6hW
@SpotifyCares Stop with generic replies. exemplifies that you don't how to reply to my response...seriously
@SpotifyCares Doesnt matter, lost customer
@SpotifyCares uhhhh, the problem somehow just fixed itself, everything works as before now. thanks for your fast and good help eitherway!!
@SpotifyCares Yes, I'll do! Thanks again
@SpotifyCares When will you be able to stream the new Taylor Swift?
@SpotifyCares Looks like it's working again. Thanks for helping
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.1.2 and Spotify 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares Nope. Also deleted and reinstalled
@SpotifyCares No it has no effect still scrambled
@SpotifyCares And now it won’t connect to any of my home blue tooth devices ??????
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6 on 3 ...it’s only happened recently all my updates are done so I don’t understand why
@SpotifyCares I can tell you I'm using a Samsung S4 o.s 5.0.1
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately no.
@SpotifyCares For spotify account
@SpotifyCares Yep, this is what happens when I complete my info it keep lodging then nothing happens https://t.co/lWqmstu2Ew
@SpotifyCares Can you reply pls?
@SpotifyCares Wired
@SpotifyCares Thanks for answering! Would seriously mean the world if the team could put it in one of the playlists!
@SpotifyCares I have had eactly the same issue on iphone ios 10.3, app 8.4 and ipad ios 9.3, app 8.4
@SpotifyCares I play directly
@SpotifyCares I login with facebbok so it's Hana Warren, my email is __email__
@SpotifyCares I installed the app and trying to signing up with Facebook and mail also but it's not working 😥
@115888
@SpotifyCares Same thing appeared on incognito
@SpotifyCares It works! 🙌🏼
@SpotifyCares Sweet. I forgot about that tab. Sorry to bother you with my silly question. You guys are the best!!
@SpotifyCares Ah, on by default and sneakily hidden under "advanced settings". I've switched it off. You should put it "off" by default, and make it enablable by the same Operating System level of configs which allows any mac app to be opened on startup.
@SpotifyCares That's unfortunate, considering I spend a respectable amount of time on VPN. I don't suppose you can say why this is? Or if it'll be fixed?
@SpotifyCares No internet when connected to wifi? https://t.co/hfm5rBa3OZ
@SpotifyCares Galaxy S7 and 8.4.25.771 play store says there is no update required at this time
@SpotifyCares #Android #app. Updated to latest version both app and phone
@SpotifyCares The three dots that u press to get further options like artist, add to **** The hit box is too small, always end up playing instead that'sit
@SpotifyCares No error message, just random skipping while playing in the car.
@SpotifyCares The problem subsided after I turned wifi off on my phone. Guessing the signal interfered with Bluetooth
@SpotifyCares On an LG g4 https://t.co/NQrtIvnEa0
@SpotifyCares android connected to honda accord
@SpotifyCares So responsive! 👏 Hopefully it will be able to play soon 🙇  thanks for the information by the way
@SpotifyCares Suggestion is yours to take! It would be nice to see such customized playlist.
@SpotifyCares I know but I like to know what's a newly released ALBUM as opposed to just newly released singles.
@SpotifyCares I see a new release tab ... this is not tailored for the user and is a ton of pop music I would never listen to
@SpotifyCares User name is mattkalman... this feature has been in some versions  and it seems like you take it out and then add it back on a whim
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Let them know it's not just me but also thousands of other @115888 customers considering switching. I'm sure @116935 would love to take more of our $$ to use with @115833
@SpotifyCares Great. An official update and commitment to support this would be appreciated. Appears that the request has been ignored for over a year. This should be a simple thing to provide. Especially for people already paying for premium and family services.
@SpotifyCares mac version: 10.13
spotify version: 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares okay, will let you know if I see this again
@SpotifyCares that didn't work. here is my typical workflow:
 - listen to some podcasts one day
 - leave spotify open on computer
 - click back into that same podcast next day
 - new episodes are not there
 - quit app, relaunch, new episodes are there
@SpotifyCares Check ur dms
@SpotifyCares I don't have an email associated with my Spotify account, because the login is connected to my Facebook. Do you mean my Facebook email?
@SpotifyCares Thankyou @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares nevermind i got it done, thank uuuuu
@SpotifyCares Sure, 8.4.21.508 armV7
@SpotifyCares ...and I'm not aware of a certain update causing this. Switching to High quality downloads was the change that seemed to cause it.
@SpotifyCares Sure, it is behaving much better after a device restart.  I'll see if it keeps up. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I was listening on my mobile whilst biking so couldn't watch. I could hear the commercial tho (wasn't at the start of playlist)
@SpotifyCares biked 26 mintues and got 3 commercial blocks, for 30min addfree music. Also keeps saying I should watch a clip but I'm on mobile, listening
@SpotifyCares Thanks just little ascetics make the music listening better!
@SpotifyCares just noticed randomly today nothing has changed on my end I haven't used it in a week or so prior
@SpotifyCares Turned this computer off for the night and relogged today to the same problem.  Song I click on plays the same wrong song
@SpotifyCares Doing the exact same thing in firefox.  The same wrong song is played as Chrome when clicking on the song I want
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares thanks, I have sent a message via that link but I haven't had a response yet. Is that normal or should I send it again.
@SpotifyCares Thank you. My issue has now been resolved. Great service
@SpotifyCares It was probably a bug or some cache issues, I got it to work now, thanks!
@SpotifyCares i trust you💖
@SpotifyCares yas you should add their solo' single to that playlist!! it would be nice and makes a lot of fans very happy!! thxx

https://t.co/vbfW2T6gHB
@SpotifyCares Cleverrrr!
@SpotifyCares reveal your identity 😫❤️
@SpotifyCares Oh gee I didn't expect y'all to reply 💀💀
But I appreciate it! ❤️😂
@SpotifyCares i downloaded songs on my computer and added them to my playlist on spotify but they wont show up on mobile
@SpotifyCares Okay. Thankyou.
@SpotifyCares Thankyou. My problem solved. 👌🏻
@SpotifyCares The latest version of Spotify. It’s only been since I have updated the app
@SpotifyCares Worked a treat! Thanks so much.
@SpotifyCares I’m using 1.0.66.478.g1296534d now. I was still working with 1.0.64. Proxy is configured. Do you still support environments with proxies?
@SpotifyCares Following error message I get since upgrading to Spotify  1.0.66.478.g1296534d https://t.co/lkA0SrdfKC
@SpotifyCares No it does not. That’s why I’m asking if proxies are still supported with 1.66? Exactly the same settings worked well with 1.64 https://t.co/NBXOTbrY2A
@SpotifyCares No it makes no difference. According to firewall logs, Spotify tries to connect directly even if a proxy is configured.
@SpotifyCares The proxy seems to block Spotify traffic towards 104.199.65.135:4070. Are there any proxy/firewall requirements somewhere?
@SpotifyCares Yes there are some restrictions, that’s why I’m asking what needs to be opened?
@SpotifyCares 2: as requests towards  104.199.65.135:4070 are not standard HTTP web traffic, access must be allowed explicitly. What needs to be opened?
@SpotifyCares Sure, makes sense. Done. Thx.
@SpotifyCares The worry is entirely to do with remembering my poor music choices - the playlist itself is wonderful.
@SpotifyCares tried in chrome incognito and edge, still playing the same incorrect songs, dont have another device to try
@SpotifyCares neither worked :s
@SpotifyCares desktop app works fine, and does seem to have the random unresponsiveness thats normal with web player either
@SpotifyCares still not fixed
@SpotifyCares or does nothing at all, but thats a long standing problem thats normally fixed by refreshing the page several times
@SpotifyCares not getting any error messages. just when pushing play next to a song, it plays a different one from my saved songs list. https://t.co/AkQEIie2DS
@SpotifyCares Thank you.
@SpotifyCares @115888 @116130 Why would you set a limit at all?
@SpotifyCares I've just saved albums and I'd imagine I'd have hundreds (maybe we'll say 400?) so maybe ballpark 5,000?
@SpotifyCares Ye on all tracks doesn’t happen on other apps. If I put the EQ all the way up on all frequencies and then back to flat it gets a bit louder
@SpotifyCares Yeah I’ve done a reinstall and closed the app
@SpotifyCares I’ve got Spotify on my laptop, is that what you need?
@SpotifyCares It’s logged in on my laptop, what am I looking for?
@SpotifyCares It’s almost as though the app is turning down the output gain on the headphone amplifier
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6SE, IOS 10/11 (updated today), 8.4.20.535. The audio sounds kinda compressed and just a lot quieter than it should be
@SpotifyCares I would have had 
If there was service in India 
😂
But seriously thanks for replying
@SpotifyCares What an irony 
You reply with a voice message that doesn't play in my country 😂😂😂
@SpotifyCares 2) rather than that if you introduced regular service so many would opt rather than choosing Apple music or Google or any other service
@SpotifyCares I did that years ago no use ,
Don't know how you people can ignore India , which is such a big market
@SpotifyCares @115888 Come on that's absurd SOMEONE at Spotify can email me the list from last week. Pretty absurd if u don't tell me.
@SpotifyCares Its not how I feel. It's a FACT that many @115888 employees have access to that info so please send it to me.
@SpotifyCares @115888 I won't take no for an answer or stop so make it happen!
@SpotifyCares You must think I'm stupid. I know for a fact that @115888 CAN retrieve this info even if u can't personally. Figure this out!
@SpotifyCares sometimes i can get into a playlist but not more for 5minutes then it "loads" again. works fine on my phone and ps4
@SpotifyCares doesn't work unfortunately, also deleted the app numerous times and reinstalled as well
@SpotifyCares hi it's OS Sierra and the latest spotify update ( 1.0.64.399.g4637b02a )
@SpotifyCares Here's hoping
@SpotifyCares Will do my dude, stay safe shit be crazy
@SpotifyCares No, that didnt solve it either
@SpotifyCares That didnt work either, I am still having the issue.
@SpotifyCares No luck, the update did not help
@SpotifyCares I will try it as soon as I can. I will be in touch
@SpotifyCares Hey I am using an iphone 6 with iOs 11.0.1 and the version of spotify is 8.4.20.535. The issue is when connected to bluetooth in my car
@SpotifyCares Thank you guys,  yes we really need Spotify for Android in Africa.
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you Spotify but will it launch in Africa soon.
@SpotifyCares You need to fix that. Seriously. My taste has changed over the course of having Spotify.
@SpotifyCares I've done that twice already.  It works for a day at best then stops.
@SpotifyCares no, it didn't :( tried everything but I still can't create the playlist. it's not even greyed out but nothing happens after clicking on it.
@SpotifyCares i tried and it's still the same... moreover, my song history is always empty, so I can't find songs from previous Discover playlists :(
@SpotifyCares no, I tried that as well and just reinstalled again - didn't help. yes, that's what I mean.
@SpotifyCares i'll dm yall!!
@SpotifyCares @160530 What if I signed up for premium and already have it but don’t have Hulu?
@SpotifyCares Thanks, should I DM?
@SpotifyCares Google Pixel
@SpotifyCares Yeah only when I click on share. Works totally fine otherwise.
@SpotifyCares I tried those things as well as uninstalling and reinstalling, it first happened last Friday the 29th
@SpotifyCares No, that didn't work. Still crashes the app.
@SpotifyCares Yes, I tried that as well. Still not working.
@SpotifyCares While trying to share.
@SpotifyCares Pixel AND Pixel XL, both running 8.0. Both with latest Spotify version 8.4.21.508.
@SpotifyCares I'm running Sierra on the Mac and Nougat on my Android phone. Neither Spotify app will play music for more than 30 seconds.
@SpotifyCares Yess! Thanks 👌🏾
@SpotifyCares You should at least make it possible to view the address when you own the account. But thanks for the quick response.
@SpotifyCares nuuuuuuh 🐻😭
alrighties and thank you for the help!
@SpotifyCares just this one. i’ve checked two other playlists and neither is affected.
@SpotifyCares same deal - resynced and got the second error message again. sigh. this playlist might have stuff from my itunes library on it (local content) - does that make any difference? https://t.co/0RV0yLG8MW
@SpotifyCares it's a playlist in a set of folders. full path is "feeling kind of... -&gt; ...emo -&gt; (all of the emo diaries)". 119 songs. i was connected to wi-fi and got the errors i shared earlier.  but when i paired over bluetooth i was able to play the playlist. heard of that problem before?
@SpotifyCares seems to be a problem with a specific playlist that has a lot of offline content. i switched to my daily mix and i can connect to devices. but i can’t go back to the content i wanted; i get this: https://t.co/ObXEz7RbYG
@SpotifyCares The question though, is WHY is it not possible. Is it not just an arbitrary limit? Is it not just changing the length of a list?
@SpotifyCares I did so, and moved storage onto device so not an sd card problem. Problem still happening. Is this a glitch with the app?
@SpotifyCares Just on that first one, what is this insanity?! Is it creating a new device every time I try to download? (I only have 1 Android phone) https://t.co/wLVV4DnJjq
@SpotifyCares @117153
@SpotifyCares It's ok now, it was returning errors for like 5 minutes straight but started working again.
@SpotifyCares I am unable to use Unidays as I am studying the ACCA qualification. I have a validated NUS, is there nothing I can do? Thanks
@SpotifyCares Hello?
@SpotifyCares No, I didn't.  I also have a different email for my fb acct and different email for my spotify.
@SpotifyCares 8.4.20.535 :) actually seem to go bad when my screen goes off due to inactivity
@SpotifyCares Just comes up with my Facebook name😩 was trying to log in with my tv earlier and it wouldn’t let me
@SpotifyCares Ok thankyou. He'll contact you guys shortly.
@SpotifyCares Great thanks. Also @28407 's "Road to hell" (1989) album, would be fantastic! Keep me noted, thanks.
@SpotifyCares Thank you for you're service. I have a HP Elite X3 with the newst build. Yes it's happening on other devices to. Mutch feedback in the store
@SpotifyCares So crashing after 10 Minutes of youse, critical Background Music bugs and incorrect downloads is the best experience on Windows you can? https://t.co/Dmzx4GPr31
@SpotifyCares it also shows the nonsense name on the receipt i got from you. It's fine on the desktop &amp; mobile apps though.
@SpotifyCares I'd be your UK ambassador  if you want?
@SpotifyCares Sure! Sending now!
@SpotifyCares Okay, coz i wanted to subscribe to premium but you don't accept cards from Kenya.
@SpotifyCares iphone 5s, the latest version 8.420
@SpotifyCares phone and computer to finally get it working on the web player
@SpotifyCares And not have to sort through ALL new music.
@SpotifyCares All is good now. I waited an hour or so and re-tried and it worked. Thank you :)
@SpotifyCares Every time I do so, it says session timed out. I have tried on 2 different devices? Is there a way you could help? :)
@SpotifyCares That big green shuffle button should be Play not shuffle https://t.co/7E4hp6osJ8
@SpotifyCares How do I disable shuffle?
@SpotifyCares iPhone with iOS 9.3. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I had a university subscription, the payment was canceled last week for lack of money.

@SpotifyCares The songs are playing but a noise gets on the way after every second. I'm using a Windows Nextbook.

@SpotifyCares Windows desktop
@SpotifyCares no.
@SpotifyCares No, I can not find the playlist on my cell phone, the tab "podcasts" does not exist when I am on the mobile, I find only related terms. But in my laptop, the tab is there and I can play it.
@SpotifyCares It happens to all poadcast's list, I have a LG Optimus II, and android 4.1.2, The spotify version is 8.4.21.508 arm V7
@SpotifyCares Hi~ 🤗 Thank you for the prompt reply. I will surely email them about this. :)
@SpotifyCares It happens on my iPhone app, MacBook air desktop app and iMac desktop app. This isn't anything new, it's just getting worse.
@SpotifyCares You’ve responded with this same bogus reply a million times. Don’t respond unless you’re actually going to listen to your customers
@SpotifyCares 11.0.2
@SpotifyCares It’s was after an iOS update
@SpotifyCares If I get 500 rts can I have free Spotify premium for a year? https://t.co/n8Q0l3Ky0A
@SpotifyCares Thank you for responding!! 💓
@SpotifyCares Sadly not: 2 devices, use Spotify every day, up to date install, no SD card, available music. Anything else?
@SpotifyCares It worked after a few attempts
@SpotifyCares It’s Wednesday pal. Not on it tonight
@SpotifyCares Today I update it and I was charged a normal premium subscription. Whats happened??
What will we do??
@SpotifyCares Should be US
@SpotifyCares Oh darn it!! Thanks Spotify! Your the best!
@SpotifyCares It’s on my phone as well now. Did the HK team change the playlist name maybe? If so, I’m wondering if there’s a way to choose English https://t.co/b2N3jpTLnA
@SpotifyCares perfect, thank you!
@SpotifyCares Hi! I tried that. I’ve always used Eng &amp; never had the playlists’ language switch till today. Also logged out/in &amp; restarted. https://t.co/DZAhE5hw4M
@SpotifyCares And I already did every trouble shooting step, it is the code int eh app, #accessibility #fail
@SpotifyCares Done, although I don't think that was needed. This is a #accessibility violation as  we are excluded from accessing that part of the app.
@SpotifyCares I feel I should make that clear as many have ben told to contact apple about this. Thanks again.
@SpotifyCares Done and still not working. I don't understand why I can't download using cellular. https://t.co/JClu6cBQWN
@SpotifyCares I've change my signal to 3g and it's not working. https://t.co/ist88blyGi
@SpotifyCares How? Show me the way
@SpotifyCares Just for the example https://t.co/V0r5WVSwGQ
@SpotifyCares Now seems I can use storage device to save. Bt the song I've been downloaded can't play offline. I hv to re-download. Where's all my songs?
@SpotifyCares I can't save my downloaded song to my storage device even it's availabe
@SpotifyCares Hi! What about laptop?
@SpotifyCares Hello! I did as you said and it still only shows 3 people I follow :O
@SpotifyCares Nope still doesn't work :(
@SpotifyCares macbook 2016, os x el capitan, app version 1.0.60.492
@SpotifyCares ho there, i just want you to know that your branch in Indonesia is suck!! they force me to pay something that i don't subscribe!
@SpotifyCares That's the point.. i don't have spotify account but your company in Indonesia keep charging me for the service!
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares It's a throwback to winamp.  As far as I know, it's the only media client that had the feature, unless there were clones of it.
@SpotifyCares A mini player view?   Something that shows play controls, Track info but in a mini view so the whole client doesnt need to be visible.
@SpotifyCares sick and tired of these standard responses. This has been the hottest topic for a month now, and you still have not responded with substance
@SpotifyCares again, the same standard answer you posted 1 month ago. We want an update on what you are going to do with all the complaints.
@SpotifyCares I am sure this is a "bot" answering the questions. What a disrespect.
@SpotifyCares So, you are human. Now update me on the status of the Touch Preview issue. You have received one month of complaints. What are next steps.
@SpotifyCares i think you have a portfolio of "non descript" standard responses like this :( 
How can this be so after a month of daily complaints.
@SpotifyCares Manuelly do the arrangement. So I can I have the right order of like 10 songs without putting it on shuffle. And it being out of order
@SpotifyCares Get it done as soon as possible if u can. And thank u for passing on the info. I'll be waiting for the update
@SpotifyCares Sure thing I’ll check and revert with my findings ... thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the quick response!
@SpotifyCares @166078 Thanks for the support 👍🏾
@SpotifyCares Used it at work and school and neither worked. I'll reset my router at home though
@SpotifyCares What would you suggest for a public network?
@SpotifyCares Doesn't seem to have worked. It's definitely not blocked though, it's worked up until recently
@SpotifyCares Lenovo Yoga, Windows 10, Spotify version 1.0.64.399.g4637b02a
@SpotifyCares I understand completely. They have always avoided a lot of mainstream outlets. But still wishful thinking :-).
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares clip: https://t.co/0uPIONtPZv ; songs: spotify:track:3TErrbPIxH0QwiLle9mlvs ; spotify:track:0WXnHgyLOOdWI4Z9935ezn . He uses NZ spotify
@SpotifyCares i try to save manually but i ALWAYS forget &amp; then im super sad i can't find the previous weeks songs.  Any chance I could get some help?
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares @11664 :( heeey is there someway i could get this 😣😣
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Pixel and I'm using version 8
@SpotifyCares Dmed!
@SpotifyCares Did you manage to find an answer?
@SpotifyCares It happens on my WiFi and LTE on le iPhone 6s Plus and t mobile?
@SpotifyCares Nope restarting or reinstalling doesn’t help it’s on everything
@SpotifyCares NO. it was a mistake. i accidentally tapped thumbs down but i loved the track. your ui is bogus! give me an UNDO
@SpotifyCares thanks for the swift reply
@SpotifyCares So that's a yes? I have to pay to not shuffle my personal music?
@SpotifyCares Are you referring to authorized accounts or just friends?
@SpotifyCares I could send members of my house to join the family account. I'm only utilizing 2 such accounts at present, would like to utilize more
@SpotifyCares nope, still not working
@SpotifyCares 😍😍 yall are the best
@SpotifyCares This is the worst music app I've ever tried, and I am losing my #groovemusic app for this ?? Really @115890 ??
@SpotifyCares @169550 I have the same problem...
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much 😀
@SpotifyCares Chrome reset to defaults gets an endless spinner.  So does an Incognito window.
@SpotifyCares USA.  The iPhone app says "an unknown error has occurred."  I also tried switching phone and laptop from wifi to a phone network.  No change
@SpotifyCares On Firefox, it's simply the signup form with a spinner in the center.  The browser console looks like this: https://t.co/JKnhOkvpxY
@SpotifyCares This is the latest version of Spotify on Windows 10 Mobile. https://t.co/v0ZZMdAmNq
@SpotifyCares Please tell me you're creating a new application for Windows Phone🙏
@SpotifyCares All the playlist 😔
@SpotifyCares I reinstall but still the problem 😔
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/t1VR724onN this is the playlist thx :)
@SpotifyCares I see. Anyway, I will just patiently wait for it. Thank you :)
#MissUniverse #Philippines
@SpotifyCares Awww. You're being so thoughtful. Copy that. Again, thank you. 😘
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/hFaFxyEDhz this is the one i can't listen to (track 14), it sends me to track 5
@SpotifyCares There’s no reason for my downloads to be removed! And sometimes it happens to some artists I think you should fix the app
@SpotifyCares Mostly the Killers and Dua Lipa
@SpotifyCares Awesome! HTC 10 running Android 7.0 and Spotify 8.4.21.508 armV7.
@SpotifyCares Afraid not. This has been on and off for at least a month. Thinking about it, possibly only on this playlist.
@SpotifyCares Yeah I’m back in :) thanks!
@SpotifyCares The windows 10 troubleshooter is reporting your site as not responding.
@SpotifyCares Should also point out that https://t.co/0VsQUdEztq connects fine and all other sites are coming up fine, just https://t.co/MBkDfYl2Xy isn't.
@SpotifyCares Already done both those. I have a degree in computing so I know what I'm doing.
@SpotifyCares Already done that too, wayyy ahead of you. No joy.
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately not, I’ve also tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but that’s not working either
@SpotifyCares Hi, 8.4.20.535 thanks
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I totally appreciate the licensing difficulties, was just commenting on how it's a real drawback for all streaming platforms.
@SpotifyCares ...2/2: session. But opening Spotify later to use again had same problem. And again this morning.
@SpotifyCares Updated to iOS 11.0.2. Deleted Spotify and reinstalled. Same problem exists. ARGH!!! I see other people tweeting about it - when’s the fix?!
@SpotifyCares Works for one session. Next time you open Spotify the same problem comes back
@SpotifyCares i’ve an iphone 7 with spotify premium and the latest update of the spotify app
@SpotifyCares restarting fixed it, thankyou!
@SpotifyCares Pssh already did you guys have been sitting on this forever. 😒
@SpotifyCares You’re cool
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Can you also tell them this is how music apps have worked since the Triassic period? And send them this GIF https://t.co/ttFtwIOCbZ
@SpotifyCares nope still randomly skips songs even tho im not even touching the keyboard
@SpotifyCares at first it was fine then it skipped to another song
@SpotifyCares pc with windows 10, spotify desktop version.
@SpotifyCares It's Spotify version 8.4.22.857 armV7 on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ running Android 7.0
@SpotifyCares This is the 4th or 5th time I've noticed that this particular song is next in the queue when the app freezes. https://t.co/vRcm1VRcZy
@SpotifyCares Yes, it's on a playlist I follow from you guys. (Viva Latino - Top 50 by Spotify) I don't know if I can remove if the playlist isn't mine.
@SpotifyCares It keeps saying I need premium but everything else works fine?
@SpotifyCares Great! Can you let me know their response please? This is such a basic request in this day and age! Seriously.
@SpotifyCares Hello! The most basic kind. I want to sort my playlists by A-Z!
@SpotifyCares you win, I went to your feedback site.have determined it’s not worth my time to  complain about this anymore. ( it’s not like I pay for it)
@SpotifyCares That’s good and all. but it doesn’t explain why I only hear about 25 of the 200 songs on the playlist. I listen pretty much all day. 🤔
@SpotifyCares I have a playlist of over 200 songs and I only hear the same 20 to 25 of them.
@SpotifyCares give me it for free or i’m going to apple music
@SpotifyCares Pixel XL running Android O (8.0.0). It started after a Spotify update last week or so, but I am not sure which one.
@SpotifyCares Hi! It affects every track, album, and playlist. I have both cleared the data from the app settings and uninstalled the app.
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares @33001 The page is https://t.co/yf24oY6N3U

Cheers! Xx
@SpotifyCares @33001 (...) and they’re appearing twice on our “popular” tracks list- is there any way of combining the number of streams for both versions? (...)
@SpotifyCares Done! Thanks!!! 💝
@SpotifyCares I’m holding you to that!!!
@SpotifyCares Who’s the content provider? @11888 ? I’ll tweet them every day instead :-)
@SpotifyCares I already tried that but I keep getting this: https://t.co/1U4HcpGicE
@SpotifyCares It isn't there and I scrolled all the way through.
@SpotifyCares thank you
@SpotifyCares Hi , I Can't download my collection to spotify only the playlists. I can't have the 60 free premium days, only 30 ☹
@SpotifyCares Thanks i shall do that
@SpotifyCares Ooh, who does it? and how can I do it? #DreamJob
@SpotifyCares Still no joy, it's only when a video comes up on the feed, never happened before
@SpotifyCares thanks y’all, love u. this is why i’m loyal 💚💚💚
@SpotifyCares I’ll try that next time it cuts out. It’s working at the moment after I logged out and reset the phone earlier. Thanks
@SpotifyCares I’m on iOS 11.0.1 and Spotify version 8.4.20.535. Thanks
@SpotifyCares @171000 I have the same issue but while this works, in another day or 2 I have to do the same again! Surely there is another fix?
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.1 and spotify 8.4.20 i can’t control my music when its on from the lockscreen :(
@SpotifyCares new page is looking good
@SpotifyCares And that's a dealbreaker for me. But thanks for caring :) If you ever do add proper library management, I'll reconsider.
@SpotifyCares Done that already. Now how do I get local music to show up under Songs/Artists/Albums, side-by-side with streamed music?
@SpotifyCares Errr..OK then. As you were. https://t.co/sABdtCRell
@SpotifyCares thank you 💖💖
@SpotifyCares I have 9342 tracks in Songs
@SpotifyCares 😩
@SpotifyCares I can't seem to vote for that idea, the + vote button is disabled although I'm logged in.
@SpotifyCares Incognito did the trick, apparently I had to create a community account first but that wasn't triggered with my existing logged in browser.
@SpotifyCares -Internet because it says it doesnt need it. I need my music for school pls help xoxo
@SpotifyCares Alright so i got premium (free trial) and it wont work, i go to play the songs and they say they are playing but they arent! Im not using-
@SpotifyCares I have both and Android phone and a Linux laptop, the songs are gone on both, and it just happened about 20 minutes ago.
@SpotifyCares Username is scopixar515 if that helps
@SpotifyCares Spotify's updated to 8.4.20, iOS 11.0.1, iPhone 6S Plus. Everything's running fine until I switch apps
@SpotifyCares works like a charm now. thanks !
@SpotifyCares Microsoft Surface, Windows 10. Worked fine yesterday!
@SpotifyCares Everything that should be clickable is clickable. And the clicks register (I can see the player respond to the click). But it doesn't play. https://t.co/SkcWN1VW06
@SpotifyCares I'm on a high-speed wired connection and all other web functionality is 100%. Have cleared cache &amp; restarted browser.
@SpotifyCares Out of patience &amp; time. Working in silence it is ...
@SpotifyCares Thank you! I would die without this weekly playlist! :)
@SpotifyCares America
@SpotifyCares Spotify version 8.4.21.508
and my phone just got the newest system update.
@SpotifyCares It does not.
@SpotifyCares Just got around to doing this and all it did was cancel my premium and delete all my songs... 🙃
@SpotifyCares Google pixel XL Spotify 8.4.21.508 arm v7
@SpotifyCares Twitter
@SpotifyCares Yeah, quite a few.
@SpotifyCares I don’t have a ‘local files’ tab on my mobile
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/7fw0SwUdG9
@SpotifyCares Hi! It's been a month. Any updates on accessing #Spotify on Smart TVs? Or is this just going to slip away quietly?
@SpotifyCares Lol thx y'all
@SpotifyCares Seems to be working now! Cheers 👍🏻
@SpotifyCares Yo, still having loads of issues with Spotify - removing my downloads, no lock screen controls etc. Resetting solves short term but no fun
@SpotifyCares Haha sure, hopefully I remember my password or you may never see me again
@SpotifyCares It works but doesn’t seem to be integrated. No lock screen controls, volume doesn’t affect the app unless used within the app etc
@SpotifyCares Galaxy A5 2017 OS: ANDROID 7.0. SPOTIFY: 8.4.21.508 armV7
@SpotifyCares yes, i've tried everything :(
@SpotifyCares I did it... but nothing happened.. still having the same problem :(
@SpotifyCares im using iPhone 6, iOS 11.0.1 and Spotify version 8.4.20.535.... the problem starts when I updated iOS to 11.. and keeps with 11.0.1
@SpotifyCares I have a problem with Shuffle, it doesn't work in my car (Mazda 6 2014)..  when I connect, the shuffle sign turns off..
@SpotifyCares the only thing i got to go on is a billing from you guys???
@SpotifyCares he dont know when he made the problem is then that i cant find the account to canncel it. What should i do in this case since
@SpotifyCares PLEASE help!
@SpotifyCares I can't believe only 3,000 of us want this. There have to be more.
@SpotifyCares spotify:artist:19t4krGrwyr10giUMdv8BK - There is whole album that isn't by @9943 called Wuste Lieder or something
@SpotifyCares This one doesn't want to be there https://t.co/EDeyBOcjBG
@SpotifyCares I have it installed on an iPhone as well. No pop-ups.
@SpotifyCares I first noticed about 5 days ago.
@SpotifyCares Spotify for Desktop 1.0.64.399 on OS X El Capitan 10.11.6
@SpotifyCares This is UX fail IMO. It should have a simple ‘clear’ option with a playlist. I don’t want to select 50 songs in my bigger playlist.
@SpotifyCares Btw, I am using Spotify on iPhone 7 running iOS 11.
@SpotifyCares @173803 So if I already have premium do I get Hulu now?
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately, that did nothing. I downloaded a 55-song playlist on my android phone in the time my iphone took to download 2 songs.
@SpotifyCares Wifi. On same connection, my Pixel downloads songs in a couple seconds. iPhone can take minutes per song.
@SpotifyCares Thank you, that's good to know. :-)
@SpotifyCares Sure. I'm using the One Plus 2 with Android 6.0.1 and Spotify Version 8.4.21.508 armV7
@SpotifyCares No tried it a dozen times. Even uninstall it and reinstalled it multiple times
@SpotifyCares Both.
@SpotifyCares Tried both and no change
@SpotifyCares Will I lose my playlists and downloaded songs?
@SpotifyCares Uninstalled and reinstalled and restarted the phone and songs are still jumping. Will be cancelling my subscription
@SpotifyCares It's Spotify version 8.4.21.508 armV7 on Samsung s6 edge. It's happening on both Wi-Fi and 4g
@SpotifyCares All songs, on my android phone
@SpotifyCares Spotify 1.0.64.399.g4637b02a and OSX El Capitan version 10.11.6
@SpotifyCares Noo I have to Re install everytime
@SpotifyCares I did restart ny network! I did everything.....it's weird! There's no problem with Apple Music..
@SpotifyCares Hi, thanks for this. its __email__
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/NptxOGnl0p
@SpotifyCares Tried incog, same case :( https://t.co/dY2NNZXoGj
@SpotifyCares Woooorks :) https://t.co/KH4mrSxEwI
@SpotifyCares but just in case you still need the info to check on this issue, I'm on iOS 11.0.2, app version 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares Well, I found the correct song on a different album but that doesn't change the fact this album is broken so you might want to check it. https://t.co/mDDCbOWqHe
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/7TdhVfq21J it's comes up as I will survive but look at the album title and cover.
@SpotifyCares even on an incognito desktop browser the results are the same https://t.co/njV9qHtWFD
@SpotifyCares it's the same across my iPad, iPhone, android device and desktop... it can't be an issue on my end can it?
@SpotifyCares Android phone and windows pc
@SpotifyCares When i go on to create an artist account, it makes me pick from a list of artists already on spotfiy and then verify that i am them but im not them i am trying to put my music onto spotify for other people to find
@SpotifyCares Also the same thing that i get when i try to upload music
@SpotifyCares Cheers Samsung s7 edge android 7.0 and Spotify premium version 8. Something. 🖒
@SpotifyCares No it's a downloaded playlist. It stops playing half way through the song. You can't skip forward or back then the app crashes
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/PAbwGNKgkT cheers
@SpotifyCares My account is currently on germany
@SpotifyCares Yes i cant see it although i already turn it on
@SpotifyCares My app version is 8.4.21 and my android version is 6.0.1
@SpotifyCares No not at all
@SpotifyCares This one here, sir. (shout out to @13078 /@13079 ) and I have a Google Pixel under Google/Android interface. https://t.co/b2iPPk8Ihp
@SpotifyCares @13078 @13079 I will see if my entire system needs an update rn. That's how important this is to me.
@SpotifyCares Sharing it still not working. Uninstalled/reinstalled - saw the app did an update - no phone updates. Please send help.
@SpotifyCares It is working and for that I want to thank you! 👏👏🤘🤘🙌
@SpotifyCares Yeah no prob, I don't have an email for it though, signed up through Facebook.

@SpotifyCares So when is a decision going to be made? It's been known that customers have wanted an Explicit filter for years #ProveSpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Hi Spotify. How's that request coming along. Found this today - Google/YouTube leading the way in social responsibility #ProveSpotifyCares https://t.co/I0sNawAOmH
@SpotifyCares Oh look. Here's another one...from GOOGLE PLAY! If their engineers can do it why can't yours?   #ProveSpotifyCares https://t.co/TML4ApjIDG
@SpotifyCares Me again. Just wanted to follow up to see how you guys are getting along with putting in that filter? #ProveSpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Good to hear it. When is "soon"? #ProveSpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Guess who? So when is spotify going to show some social responsibility? Explicit filter please! #ProveSpotifyCares @147836
@SpotifyCares @147836 So, it's been a while. How you doing? Daniel have you made any progress on the Explicit filter that every other music streaming service seems able to provide? My kids have just had to hear bad language because Spotify doesn't care.
@SpotifyCares @147836 Anyone would be forgiven for thinking that I'm being fobbed off. DANIEL you're very quiet on this - you have kids, are you ok with them hearing bad language? #ProveSpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares @147836 You've not given me an answer to this question......
@SpotifyCares So can you tell me why an Explicit content filter hasn't already been implemented? #ProveSpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares It's not right that my kids have to listen to bad language in music just because Spotify doesn't care
@SpotifyCares It's a 7 Plus running 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares Hey I actually got my sister to enter the account info. I think the issue was I was trying to enter it from Paris even though I'm American
@SpotifyCares since i graduated in may. helpppppp please i NEED spotify in my life
@SpotifyCares Thanks!!
@SpotifyCares Fixed it! Thank you! :D
@SpotifyCares That doesn't really make sense that his top 10 songs would be take down and half the albums are there
@SpotifyCares Would appreciate y'all adding them back. Makes my membership half as worth it
@SpotifyCares Win 10 Pro 64 bit

@SpotifyCares @115888
@SpotifyCares MacBook Pro, OS X 10.11.6, Spotify 1.0.64.399.g4637b02a. No error messages.
@SpotifyCares It’s chemicaliiz.  Thanks a lot.
@SpotifyCares Yep! app version number is 5.2.4.0 and Windows Mobile 10.0.15252.0 running on a #hpelitex3
@SpotifyCares Tried that, didn't seem to help. The problem seems to happen when resuming the App after being away from it and another App has used sound.
@SpotifyCares I tried it on my #lumia650 and it still does the same thing randomly.
@SpotifyCares Tried, does not happen on your desktop app, android or iOS.
@SpotifyCares @177704 I can confirm the same error.
Tried logging in w/native spotify account + facebook with same result.
uninstall/reinstall app
@SpotifyCares Sorry I was born in 1986, what is DM? DO you mean private message?
@SpotifyCares It's ok. I don't have a Spotify subscription so there's no point. I was just testing it out for the Windows 10 Mobile community.
@SpotifyCares 2/2 I realize the application is in maintenance mode which means no new features, but it should mean bug fixes for paying customers.
@SpotifyCares Galaxy S7 and 8.4.21.508 for spotify version. It's up to date and does not need any updates.
@SpotifyCares Lol my sisters clever! It was my earphones 🤷🏼‍♀️😂
@SpotifyCares Thanks. It did such a good job I want more!
@SpotifyCares @178316 the correct artists on the song would be @178316 (https://t.co/ut7LdsbV31) and me (https://t.co/AeaVD76eKj). Mine seems to be correct.
@SpotifyCares But the original artist is this @178316 ,and the song is now under a different Sekai. Even though it was originally under the right one.
@SpotifyCares this just felt like i was being mocked but i will gladly take the panther theme, still LMAO. TYVM. hope it gets sorted out asap. &lt;3
@SpotifyCares Any news on this one? When can we expect this to get fixed?
@SpotifyCares Fixed. ty &lt;3
@SpotifyCares I recently asked to have my multiple accounts merged. This song was one of the ones being 'moved', and I'm not sure if this is connected 1/2
@SpotifyCares Already did!
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/1Cmu2SBwPU
@SpotifyCares Wow Spotify really does care, nothing but respect for my streaming service https://t.co/03hRkCRRZP
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Still works for me thankfully. Is a great feature. Please don't remove it!
@SpotifyCares Oh and it was here...

@SpotifyCares Weird. I didn't do anything and it just started working. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Cheers.
@SpotifyCares it's still happening both phone, spotify web on desktop and desktop app
@SpotifyCares i still cannot listen to certain bands, everytime i try to listen a Blur/Kendrick Lamar/Daft Punk song it says the song is not available
@SpotifyCares Both, happens when I'm on data, on different wifis on the phone, with downloaded and not downloaded songs, and different pcs
@SpotifyCares I cleaned cache and deleted all personal information, still happening
@SpotifyCares nope, already tried that, anyway it happens on desktop app and spotify web too, it's a premium account

@SpotifyCares ...in incognito window.
@SpotifyCares I’ll let you know tomorrow if anything changed.
@SpotifyCares Well, things seem to be working now. It's playing the right song now. I guess shutting off my computer &amp; turning it back on fixed it.
@SpotifyCares Awh :(I loveeee you guys but I just got a new iwatch and now thinking about switching only because I’ll be going running without my phone..
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!! :) I appreciate it so much!!! :)
@SpotifyCares I don't know who the right team is, but thanks.  My hearing is not dealing at all well with this issue.
@SpotifyCares its cool, i'll just probably cancel my service. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares that article did not answer my question.
@SpotifyCares I have local files that I want to play on Sp and They won't sync to my mobile device.
@SpotifyCares Did that
@SpotifyCares This says it’s a Not Right Now idea. That’s insane to me
@SpotifyCares AWESOME THANKS 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
@SpotifyCares It still won't let me log into my Spotify account on the Groove app to move my music. Windows and the app are up-to-date. @115890
@SpotifyCares Sorry nevermind. My small account wasn't worth the troubleshooting. I just made a new account.  Thanks for jumping on this.
@SpotifyCares Device is Huawei Google Nexus 6P. Android 8.0. Spotify ver 8.4.21.508
@SpotifyCares Nope, I also tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Here's a recording of what I'm experiencing. https://t.co/KtSHEqkXex
@SpotifyCares The app crashes everytime I try to share a song, then it restarts playing the previous song.
@SpotifyCares Samsung s5 phone and version 8.421
@SpotifyCares I have restarted my phone a few times since it started doing it, didn't help
@SpotifyCares I rebooted my phone. It turns off when my lock screen kicks in, didn't do that before. Will tinker and see.
@SpotifyCares Hi, i'im ima, seems like my premium account has been hacked &amp; i can't login via username/email, what to do?
@SpotifyCares @181381 no shut the fuck up and fix it you dumb fucking cunt
@SpotifyCares Figured it out.     Thx
@SpotifyCares ios 11 on iphone 8.4.20.535 no error msg
@SpotifyCares Hey!
Android version is 7.0,
Spotify: https://t.co/lbETUXYIVz
@SpotifyCares Nexus 6P, Oreo (8.0), 8.4.21.508
@SpotifyCares Would tweet you if I didn't try that
@SpotifyCares I've just started the day with full 🔋😊 I'll ping you in the evening
@SpotifyCares I PMd you the screenshots, let's move this conversation there 🙃
@SpotifyCares Hii! Its okay my spotify is already working! Thanks ❤️
@SpotifyCares The song was available but now it isn't. The link didn't give me the answer to why
@SpotifyCares The song is "It's so easy" by Guns N' Roses and my account is set to US
@SpotifyCares the problem hasn't been fixed
@SpotifyCares Playlists I still see. But anything I've ever checked is mostly gone other than about 100 songs I've recently checked.
@SpotifyCares Funny enough it stopped right when i wanted to record a video about it. will report back in case it happens again.
@SpotifyCares - Nexus 6P Android 8.0.0 October security patch
- Spotify version 8.4.21.508
@SpotifyCares Just a suggestion because it would be nice to have those bonus tracks! Especially for premium users! Love you guys and use you everyday! :)
@SpotifyCares Even as I keep listening to the tracks, the ones near the bottom never become more readable, nor do any more songs show up in the list
@SpotifyCares They won't, that is the issue I'm reporting.
@SpotifyCares yes. I am in the US and I couldn't find it on the app? will it be released today?
@SpotifyCares I'm using an iPhone SE on the most recent of all. iOS 11.0.3, spotify 8.4.25
@SpotifyCares Its on WiFi. It happens on all tracks. Sometimes it works fine for 2mins etc. Other apps work fine for sound.
@SpotifyCares Still the same.
@SpotifyCares Yes I have tried re-installing the app and resetting the device.
@SpotifyCares Im on ios 10.0.2 on an iPhone 5s
@SpotifyCares And in the Album
@SpotifyCares But is that the only Thing i Can do?
@SpotifyCares It worked thank you🙏👌🏻
@SpotifyCares It's working now, just wanted to check. Any news on being able to stream podcasts to my Chromecast?
@SpotifyCares It's the 2. The round one. It has been quite intermittent recently
@SpotifyCares Thankyou for the speedy reply 😁
@SpotifyCares It's an iPhone 7, Spotify is version 8.4.18.632 cx
@SpotifyCares Still hasn't helped, won't play on bus wifi and won't play when I go off the app either..
@SpotifyCares @182962 I have 2. Here's the first. __email__
@SpotifyCares My concern is the push notifications actually? You cut that too?
@SpotifyCares thanks for the info. it's not that i don't want to link the two, it's that i don't have facebook so i don't get a photo :/
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares is this still a thing???
@SpotifyCares Samsung S7. Version '8.4.21.508'
@SpotifyCares Yes I can see these and play the little previews
@SpotifyCares As soon as I've finished listening to that new AJ Tracey, sure 😂
@SpotifyCares Yes. https://t.co/tFPfnIIzuI
@SpotifyCares Well, https://t.co/XXvIQsDeoR and https://t.co/fVyb1xihpU is one band.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/Xmuqf3JujC is another.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/1w4lAJQRZC is a third.
@SpotifyCares Ok. https://t.co/cZdR96mni7 is not the same artist as https://t.co/CfWxMbUau9
@SpotifyCares There should be a button for this.
@SpotifyCares Cool, thanks 😉
@SpotifyCares Does the code identify the difference between fun trashy songs I play to my friends and my favorites? 😉
@SpotifyCares Spotify only. You still didn’t answer my question! Are you prepping any update for ios11 or not?
@SpotifyCares 8.4.20.535, ios11.0.1
Is there an update coming for spotify to support ios11 properly?
@SpotifyCares Android 7.0 and spotify is 8.4.21.508 V7
@SpotifyCares Thanks!!
@SpotifyCares Windows 10. And the latest, I upgraded it recently
@SpotifyCares Well I've had Spotify for going on 7 Months and I listen to nothing but explicit music.
@SpotifyCares You should talk to @863 and try to get Got7 and Twice on Spotify. I need this. Please
@SpotifyCares Alright. Thank you Spotify. I'll be looking out. 👌🏽
@SpotifyCares Thank you ☺☺
@SpotifyCares Any stuff just released by elf or Dio needs to be checked as unlikely to be ronnie james Dio.
@SpotifyCares Cool, keep on rockin 🤘🏼
@SpotifyCares however while i still have you guys i can't select a bunch of songs to remove from queue, if i scroll down too far it just gets deslected
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/ciF1H8fAEa
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/z9nW77ejRa
@SpotifyCares Should I get back to you if this doesn't solve the problem?
@SpotifyCares Hey so I reinstalled and the issue is still occurring as I described.
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Microsoft Lumia 950XLWindows 10 Mobile 10.0.15252.0Spotify 5.2.4.0
@SpotifyCares Uh, none of those steps apply to my platform. 🙄 I will un/reinstall.
@SpotifyCares App is still super slow, but at least it plays now. Progress? I will test it in the car later.
@SpotifyCares Restarted yesterday several times. 

App performance may be within tolerance for Spotify, I am used to the speed of Groove.
@SpotifyCares Sweet
@SpotifyCares It skips when I don’t want it to, and stops when I don’t even press the button. I have the IPhone 8
@SpotifyCares It doesn’t I tried that. I also deleted the app and then did it over again and nothing
@SpotifyCares @147836 Cool, I know I’m not the only one frustrated by it. Tell Daniel I say hello
@SpotifyCares It does, but doesn’t solve the problem permanently. Have to keep restarting once the issue happens again
@SpotifyCares It stopped working again! I can’t even make the sound quieter with the actual sound buttons ON the phone or see Spotify on the swipe up menu
@SpotifyCares that is the first thing i tried and still doesn't work :/
@SpotifyCares nope :(
@SpotifyCares 6s** if it matters
@SpotifyCares iphone 6, i haven't updated to 11.0.2 yet, spotify is last updated october 3
@SpotifyCares I don't even know how to do that in mobile
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, IOS 11.0.3, Version 8.4
@SpotifyCares It works on my iPhone. Restarts don’t help on the PC. I also have a laptop so will check that as soon as I can.
@SpotifyCares Here is another: spotify:track:4GZC9VKsSnAzpPbFR48uRd
@SpotifyCares Neither of these work: spotify:track:0iALOYqXaVoluUIsSyDAny spotify:track:5CPqOpKSk0QcJ3dGdaWcRB
@SpotifyCares Have to say, this is really bugging me. It works sometimes &amp; not others. All of the time I'm in the UK. Now using Deezer for this one track!
@SpotifyCares Yeah I've even uninstalled and reinstalled. I feel like the solution is just looking me in the face and laughing.
@SpotifyCares thanks!
@SpotifyCares On multiple speakers, synchronised. The other one is about playing multiple streams on multiple speakers, using the same account
@SpotifyCares The real topic would be https://t.co/kNx8B5Ta5q but it has wrongly been marked as a duplicate. This one is about playing the same stream
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the feedback. It’s an album I’ve listened for years and am really glad to see it on Spotify.
@SpotifyCares About 2,000
@SpotifyCares I switched to @115948 😎 thanks tho..
@SpotifyCares Just voted on it. Thanks again you lovely Swedes.
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares you fixed it! #thankyou #spotify
@SpotifyCares Hi, I DM’d you about a problem with my account. Could you get back to me?
@SpotifyCares I've heard something like that before from you. I have started to think less of #Spotify. No changelogs, no plan for where you're going.
@SpotifyCares Well, it feels like it.
@SpotifyCares ☹️
@SpotifyCares I'm on Android and JUST did update. It'll cut out in the middle of song or 1/2way through 30min block. I clear cache, etc but still does it
@SpotifyCares Sigh. It's an LG SUNSET and the version is whatever comes up from Google playstore. Again, all updates have been done.
@SpotifyCares Awesome. I'll check that out. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I usually have my library saved. But the app randomly deleted it &amp; streamed instead. Shouldn't HAVE 2 run offline mode if I can save songs
@SpotifyCares Same problem here, Can you help me fix it?
@SpotifyCares @173904 Same problem here. Could you help me?
@SpotifyCares @186719 same problem
@SpotifyCares Free.
@SpotifyCares im trying to log back in. I forgot my password and i no longer have access to the Email linked to my account to reset my password
@SpotifyCares Just tried on MacBook macOS Sierra 10.12.6 using Chrome 61.0.3163.100 from Belarus. Activity indicators shows up, but the page is still scrollable and editable. Nothing changes on the page over time, only Recaptcha timeout happens.
@SpotifyCares @14821 The actual handle is @82632 - my friends who are also in Canada can play all of Scott's music fine but it won't let me. I NEED MY DAILY DOSE
@SpotifyCares Here you go. Every single song by Tycho, here's one: spotify:track:5EeNRe6Fi29tTrssVzl4dw https://t.co/5DOHEZTbv3
@SpotifyCares Hey, yeah sure! I really miss the radio menu. You can play one from a song, but you can't go to the page with all your radios like before :(
@SpotifyCares And also when you are in 1 of your Playlist, there is no suggestion at the end or on the side. It was so nice to discover new related music
@SpotifyCares Thank you! Please don't judge me - I have good taste, I swear... but it features @183932, so how can I not ask?!
@SpotifyCares Thank you! or even a box that will let you select all the songs that you want to delete all @ once would help.
@SpotifyCares I don’t mind speaking in English . Did you understand my issue or do you want me to explain it in English?
@SpotifyCares Nope :(
@SpotifyCares WiFi for laptop, mobile data for phone
@SpotifyCares Apparently it's not only me-asked the bf an hour away, and it goes silent for him too... :( Thanks for the quick replies!
@SpotifyCares Cuts out on my phone too...
@SpotifyCares Using it on the web.Playlists only show list of songs without checkmarks for saved songs. Also a radio tab no longer shows previous sessions
@SpotifyCares Thanx, I submitted the same complaint/suggestion before but there were no changes, improvement. With new UI finding music is so difficult
@SpotifyCares For example in playlists I no longer see/identify the songs that were saved before. UI is too large, hard to navigate and find new music.
@SpotifyCares There are so many issues that the only solution is the old UI. very sad that can't use Spotify anymore (
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Latest and iPhone 6s
@SpotifyCares BTW on my iPad the dot is still moving so I think it’s not the issue of iOS 11.0.2
@SpotifyCares You should be replying to @187968. He's the one whose music is being uploaded to your site fraudulently.
@SpotifyCares No, it was just playing normal ads, but instead of just playing audio while I navigate the app, it forced me to watch them.
@SpotifyCares It never gave me the offer. It just played 2 or 3 video ads when I was browsing.
@SpotifyCares Oh, comment on a forum thread from 2012? Would of thought you could have sorted something out in the last 5 years.
@SpotifyCares Sorry for the bluntness, but doesn't really seems that 'Spotify Cares'
@SpotifyCares I’ll be waiting till next Friday hoping for some ear porn. Thanks for chatting
@SpotifyCares yes, but not physically. i take my classes online, so i don't go to campus or have a student ID, but i'm pursuing a real Masters degree.
@SpotifyCares the united states - my school is miami university.
@SpotifyCares thanks!
@SpotifyCares Sounds like techno, not country
@SpotifyCares Those are the 3 links for all 3 tracks.
@SpotifyCares Your welcome. I should get a free month of service for this find!!😉👍
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares do u actually fukn care thooooo
@SpotifyCares I did everything except for pull down. Fantastic, thank you!
@SpotifyCares This was absolutely not a solution 🙄
@SpotifyCares Sorted. Had to delete my list of offline devices but it seems to have worked. Cheers.
@SpotifyCares yep, happens when connected to wifi and when running off 4G.
@SpotifyCares Hey thanks - Spotify Version - 8.4.23.784 armv7 Android version - 7.0
@SpotifyCares Windows 10 + Google Chrome
@SpotifyCares Maybe its just my browser
@SpotifyCares Thank you! Some of us spook easily!
@SpotifyCares huh, wouldn't you look at that.... logging out/logging back in worked. technology is weird.
@SpotifyCares i've tried restarting multiple times but not logging out/logging in. will attempt now and get back to you.
@SpotifyCares always whatever the latest episode is - changes. click it, jumps to past ep but won't play. iPhone, OS 10.3.3. Spotify v 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares I click on most recent episode of Pod Save America and it jumps to past episode. Doesn't play at all.
@SpotifyCares It's a private/home wifi. We can restart the router. Thanks for the insight
@SpotifyCares Restarting the router didn't work
@SpotifyCares First off I can't even see all of the songs on my playlist. The entire layout is the opp. of user friendly
@SpotifyCares But do you know that @15301 users are coming? https://t.co/e0io8bw4jC By the way ThankYou.
@SpotifyCares The switch is ok, it's a great work. That WP8.1 old Spotify App is a real limitation for Premium users.
@SpotifyCares @189307 Now that Microsoft is killing Groove music and trying to push everyone to Spotify I think it's about time you sorted the apps out.
@SpotifyCares okay on my mac everything works! Thanks for the great support!
@SpotifyCares awesome!! nothing against colbie but that song haunts me. 👻
@SpotifyCares @115888 But from the @118117 app I can see @115888 and resume listening
This is frequent
Now the "connect to device" is back to normal
@SpotifyCares Well, quite simple, I listen to music on @115888 and then it stops
The "connect to device" does not show "living room" it is gone!
@SpotifyCares Device is my laptop with windows 10
Spotify OS 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
No restarting
It eventually re-connect with sonos (why/how = no clue)
@SpotifyCares yes! thanks!
@SpotifyCares I have the latest version. I have an iPhone 6. iOS 11
@SpotifyCares Great thank you!!! :)
@SpotifyCares iPhone
@SpotifyCares I will, but later cause it's almost 3 am here and I'm tired.
But thanks so far for the quick support, appreciate it.
@SpotifyCares I'd really like to have a permanent fix please, If at all possible. (3/3)
@SpotifyCares And I it's honestly so annoying because it takes ages to restart the app and to have to do that several times a day is exhausting. (2)
@SpotifyCares Yes, but that can't be a long term solution, cause I have to do that every time I don't use Spotify for a little while. (1)
@SpotifyCares It's on a Windows 10 Lenovo Laptop and it's Version 1.0.65.320
@SpotifyCares And now this. I am gonna need a new laptop because I have the very strong urge to throw it out of the window right about now. https://t.co/eDFrhYL9CS
@SpotifyCares I don't use the app; I prefer the web player, so I've only seen it there. Private home network.
@SpotifyCares Here it is! Can't play the ad, can't skip, and can't play any playlist or song. No ad-blocker turned on, either. Thx in advance! https://t.co/fGKPstPWCS
@SpotifyCares Didn't work, sadly. Have also logged in on other browsers, but the same ad is there also. Also, restarted computer and cleared temp files.
@SpotifyCares You need to sit down with him and his label and get these old tracks up because they're pure gold
@SpotifyCares lol I messaged you one more question can you answer real quick
@SpotifyCares Nope. Luckily no crashing, but definitely multiple ads. Not the first time either, just the first time I've reported it.
@SpotifyCares I clicked "watch the video" and listened to Jimmy John and The Gifted... 🙄
@SpotifyCares And yes, heard the "thanks for watching"
@SpotifyCares Same thing happened again; “30 mins ad free” again with the Jimmy John ad, then had a Marshalls ad directly after, and 17 mins later another
@SpotifyCares Thank you much
@SpotifyCares The app crashes
@SpotifyCares No message pops up. I have a Google Pixel XL running Android 8.0.0
@SpotifyCares Okay. Thanks for your response.
@SpotifyCares oh shit oh right thank u xoxo
@SpotifyCares Yes, I've done the steps. OS: Silent OS, Device: Black Phone 2
@SpotifyCares No, that's not sorted it.
@SpotifyCares No error message. It just doesn't play. If I have something else playing, it stops that but doesn't start the new music.
@SpotifyCares I've just created a playlist of the album and trying to play that it says "This song not available."
@SpotifyCares Our home wifi and 4g
@SpotifyCares Spotify 8.4.22.857 armV7
Android 7.1.2
@SpotifyCares My songs came back. Thanks you guys are the best. Apple music doesn't have shit on you.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/2YdIjHSAzv

The song is available elsewhere but isn't showing up here in the US.
@SpotifyCares It's just the explicit version missing, the clean version is available here in the US.
@SpotifyCares Nope, thanks!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.3 Spotify 8.4.20
@SpotifyCares Usa
@SpotifyCares And again from Reddit to various Xbox forums it’s a very common problem.
@SpotifyCares Done
@SpotifyCares This is the only one I have. I have 200d/l and 20u/l. More then enough. Please help
@SpotifyCares Nope. No change at all
@SpotifyCares Ok. Will try that
@SpotifyCares I have both versions updated. It’s a common complaint if you read various message boards.
@SpotifyCares Seems like that won't do anything. Just don't get why there are so many terrible podcasts that are featured on Spotify. Oh well, thx anyway!
@SpotifyCares Is it that one? https://t.co/ZKpCaSSW25
@SpotifyCares I don’t really know, and when the problem happened I had one of my playlists not saved for offline. How can you check?
@SpotifyCares Yea sure, i’m using Mac and I dont really know how to check the current version of my Spotify, though I believe that it’s the newest one.
@SpotifyCares With all due respect Spotify, that's kind of dumb you gotta vote for this. Just make it happen.
@SpotifyCares @160530 Hey Spotify. Do you have any love for the armed forces? How bout a nice deal
@SpotifyCares I'll try it, thank you.😅
@SpotifyCares I'm using the premium version on my mobile phone and sadly it's happening with both
@SpotifyCares Well, some songs can't be played (complete) so I need to restart spotify about 10 times till I can keep listening if I can keep listening😅
@SpotifyCares depending on the colors of the art behind it the title can be hard to read too
@SpotifyCares No, the app was fine. It's also up to date. It's happened twice in separate times.
@SpotifyCares Yes, I did. After the ad, the person says that I have 30 minutes of ad free music.
@SpotifyCares Iphone7, iOS 10.3.3 and 8.4.20
@SpotifyCares It works now without a restart.
@SpotifyCares U.S.A
@SpotifyCares Hey, Nexus 6P and Google Pixel XL both on Oreo. Spotify version 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares Clear data, cache etc, reboot and fresh install didn't help either. Great, thanks. 🙂
@SpotifyCares No question, but I just wanted to tell that it still happens. 🙈 (only on my pixel anymore though)
@SpotifyCares This can't be that complex, or can it? 😕 I would gladly help (as an Android developer), if I can somehow. https://t.co/8i9fHxuNeQ
@SpotifyCares Latest update fixed it. Thanks for your fantastic work and support. 👌
@SpotifyCares Hi! I restarted my phone, no changes.
@SpotifyCares That fixed it! Thanks a lot and have a nice day/night! https://t.co/iNocKhGgLv
@SpotifyCares So will I have to wait till next week for this problem to be fixed? @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Yes it’s several songs though may I link all of them
@SpotifyCares Thank you.
@SpotifyCares please do! it looks absolutely incredible 💚
@SpotifyCares thanks guys!
@SpotifyCares I can't reach at Turkey Support team
@SpotifyCares Thank you. Although, explicit songs shouldn't necessarily be skipped, just a radio version / non-explicit version played instead.
@SpotifyCares Thank you :) It would make our Spotify Family subscription, family friendly ;)
@SpotifyCares Ok! I’m going to assume that my form didn’t get sent or didn’t get received and I’ll try again!
@SpotifyCares would my stats from the new page be combined to the old one? don't want to lose out on the traffic that has been produced.
@SpotifyCares check your dms!
@SpotifyCares when is that "future" gonna happen? i hope soon 😏
@SpotifyCares I really want to listen to his album already. Please make it available soon!! (And whys it not available after the mv release just asking) ☺
@SpotifyCares Please do. ☺
@SpotifyCares I have not but will do. I appreciate the info 🙏🏻
@SpotifyCares the info sent are only about Groove Music... which is totally unrelated to my post... :/
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s
@SpotifyCares It does. But doing it every five hours is just too much of a hassle for me
@SpotifyCares would do but currently in the car using my data, i’ll try and do it soon though, thank you for your help ❤️
@SpotifyCares but how about the fact that i literally cannot use the shuffle option? any way around that?
@SpotifyCares Well, this doesn’t help, quite the opposite. Couldn’t be a bigger feature to maintain :(
@SpotifyCares “seems your card or payment provider is having a bad day. Don't worry, no money has been charged. Try again or use another payment method.”
@SpotifyCares Hi! It has been rectified! Very impressed with the support team! Thank you
@SpotifyCares Live chat in English was very helpful. Hacking issue solved in less than 20 mins. Congrats !
@SpotifyCares OMG WHAT THANK U
@SpotifyCares YALL CAME THROUGH!!!! https://t.co/5sSlah2XYD
@SpotifyCares Oh please do! I don't know how long my heart can go on without that song.
@SpotifyCares I replied to the DM and then didn't get a reply again, tried Spotify again and got the same issue going on, are you going to help?
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply. All sorted now. That's a lot of 3333s! (Although a higher limit in future would be a good idea.)
@SpotifyCares Yes. But I want the original version. Not the live version.
@SpotifyCares Probably more than 5000, but I don’t understand why this matters?
@SpotifyCares This is ridiculous, why put an artificial limit to something like this? You don’t want your users to save or favourite music?
@SpotifyCares and this is the only option I have now. I can’t save or download. https://t.co/MKJsPhXtQQ
@SpotifyCares 8.4.20.535 and iOS 10.3.2 which I know isn’t the newest version but nothing in the last app update said it wasn’t compatible.
@SpotifyCares no it’s all of them except for one playlist. I click save and then nothing happens.
@SpotifyCares done, thank you.
@SpotifyCares @192597 Hi I'm having some issues with my account. Can I dm you to explain further. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares There‘s not even a replacement feature for long press. Why not leaving it up to the user by enabling the feature via settings?
@SpotifyCares It’s working now thanks :)
@SpotifyCares Thank you! OS - 10.11.6 Spotify version - 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Hey - no, that didn't help :(
@SpotifyCares Sure it's spotify:user:charleydagger:playlist:27l14IB3d7ssSH3B5CIsHH thank you!
@SpotifyCares Stand down. After a reinstall of the app, login logout and resending the invite, one or all of the above fixed the issue 👍👍👍 thanks guys!
@SpotifyCares A real update please ? There has been no real up from you. And my last post on Monday was deleted why is that ?
@SpotifyCares See https://t.co/BmshtgHD30 and https://t.co/FduSqXKDH0
@SpotifyCares @193042 AHAHAHHAAGAHHA WTF FAM
@SpotifyCares Sorry just seen this one, the other Dustin doesn't have a link. The conjoined link is https://t.co/LH4zHbfKkr
@SpotifyCares Hi @SpotifyCares It is just a case of two very different artists are being listed as the same thing essentially.Need to separate them out 👍🏻
@SpotifyCares Wouldn’t that also cause all my downloads to delete?
@SpotifyCares What you’re about to do if they get lost anyway? A cake 🎂?
@SpotifyCares You guys are so awesome 👏 
It worked and the dot is moving like it never did before
#NerdSatisfied
@SpotifyCares Yet...my spotify account still says free :/ so have i been charged for nothing? https://t.co/9qUhOys90d
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I know how it works, I just don't think it's doing a good job in this case.
@SpotifyCares You guys. You deserve every single penny I give you monthly.

Great customer care!
@SpotifyCares You haven't had any real info other than "We know it's broken" since March. You're absorbing Groove and we expect similar functionality.
@SpotifyCares I was just wondering if (and if so why) the album "revenge" by xxxtentacion was taken down???? :))
@SpotifyCares Thank you.
@SpotifyCares the location is in my Windows music library folder, seen in WMP, have tried adding the specific top-level folder but already included
@SpotifyCares It's 1.0.64.399.g4637b02a ... it's gone up to 11 files found since my first message, PC on and Spotify running the whole time
@SpotifyCares erm if I put them all in one folder I'll never be able to navigate the files easily and when I buy via other software it uses subfolders ...
@SpotifyCares @144795 *sent
@SpotifyCares @144795 Hi! I I availed premium yesterday it costs me 129 pesos even though I used debit card. Thanks. Hope you'll answer. I also send you a message.
@SpotifyCares What do you mean pricing varies by payment mode? Can I avail the 9 pesos for 3 months using BDO Debit Card or Gcash Mastercard?
@SpotifyCares Alright, thanks! I will subscribe to Spotify Premium today. ☺️
@SpotifyCares you all are so helpful. i will never stop loving you, spotify
@SpotifyCares So when @115948 deal is up, I can hope you get the last album back? Ok.
@SpotifyCares noted. Many thanks and appreciate for your respond
@SpotifyCares yes, I did, and now patiently waiting for the answer 😊😊
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Also on my Nexus 5X the app has been dying lately sometimes usually when I hit share on a song
@SpotifyCares The United States
@SpotifyCares Fix my account
@SpotifyCares Low power mode is working for now. Will do a complete device reset after I can it up and reach back out.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s iOS 11.0.2 and current Spotify. Thanks team!
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.857 armV7. Spotify premium, had family also but dropped that, which is effective next week. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares same result. 😭 Thanks tho. I've shared Spotify for years this just started. Unrelated, I factory reset last week, this happened b4 and after
@SpotifyCares I was on Oreo before I reset though, possibly a sharing update broke the weird custom sharing that only Spotify does of any app ever 😉
@SpotifyCares Got something - was able to pull a stack trace via adb. Hope this helps! https://t.co/iNiamncVkn
@SpotifyCares general "this song not available" up top in the blue bar. seems to be all songs by katy perry or mumford and sons that I've found so far 🤔
@SpotifyCares I'm on my laptop (a chromebook) and it won't let me play any songs but will on my phone.
@SpotifyCares no messaged or anything it just won't play any songs,I've tried restarting computer logging out both off my phone and laptop.
@SpotifyCares It didn't seem to help at all
@SpotifyCares Many thanks. Your support staff were able to get the issue resolved. Great customer service!
@SpotifyCares seems to be working at this stage. Will let you know if it happens again. Cheers
@SpotifyCares problem has come back again today. is there some kind of bug?
@SpotifyCares It's on a Macbook Air (early 2014), running High Sierra, spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares I think I got it figured out for now. I’ll let you know if I still have issues. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Hello! Thanks for the reply. It doesn't help and I've tried it several times. It's really slow when loading.
@SpotifyCares I'll do so. Thanks :)
@SpotifyCares I'm in cairo, egypt, and i dont think  we would have any better than you to make our life more cheerful by playing your awesome music
@SpotifyCares Thx!
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares thanks for the response!!
@SpotifyCares @196330 Hello y'all haven't responded to my text
@SpotifyCares Doesn’t let me access it lol
@SpotifyCares "The Forums Are Closed For Maintenance" So.
@SpotifyCares AND if you've removed playlists, what is the ability to login with different accounts when it goes to the same landing page?
@SpotifyCares RIiiiiiggghhhhhhhhttt. You keep telling your users that.
@SpotifyCares I have Facebook two factor authentication on but your service bypasses that. I have used "log out of all" twice now and changed password
@SpotifyCares Now that I've contacted and spoke with an agent, I can't sign in.
@SpotifyCares Yes I’m using a IPhone 6 and it won’t let me log in the app but it lets me log into Spotify on google and I tried different accounts .nope!!
@SpotifyCares Well kind of a first word problem here, but it only does it when I’m on Bluetooth. Any particular reason why that might be?
@SpotifyCares thx mate
@SpotifyCares -gets priority and plays from there. I have to go into Airplane mode while it's connected to another device just to go Offline. Ridiculous.
@SpotifyCares People have been complaining about this since 2014. It's a know issue that the company seems to be neglecting. If it's not possible, say it.
@SpotifyCares It appears to be normal on regular playlists. Cutting off the left and right album art is aesthetically poor and odd.
@SpotifyCares It seems to happen on the Time Capsule playlist. iPhone 6s. Version 8.4 on Spotify.
@SpotifyCares It’s happening for every song, every album.
@SpotifyCares Here https://t.co/VV9GOBAu52
@SpotifyCares it didn't :(
@SpotifyCares but for real though, updating the 'this is justin bieber' with all his songs would be so good
@SpotifyCares Open Discord, Spotify stops playing. I think it confiscates full control of the audio driver as YouTube doesn't work on chrome either.
@SpotifyCares Really weird, never had this problem with discord before. On 2014 XPS 13.
@SpotifyCares Nicki Minaj is trendy and she’s featured on the song and Fergie is a legend, don’t let them down 😭
@SpotifyCares Thank youN
@SpotifyCares i know you’re not the ones to do it but make them add this song by Fergie and Nicki Minaj, it could be a hit 😭
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you!
@SpotifyCares The logo is just going dark for some reason lol. It’s version 8.4.20
@SpotifyCares People shouldn't need to bother. It's a basic feature. Sort it out.
@SpotifyCares if you care please add Expensive Girl by Kim Namjoon onto Spotify
@SpotifyCares united states 🇺🇸
@SpotifyCares Both options did not work.
@SpotifyCares Thanks - looks like I have to fill out a Contact Us form since the email address in my account was taken over from a hack.
@SpotifyCares I'm not sure how to fix that bit. To get it to say my name and my followers/playlists.
@SpotifyCares Tried playing from different albums and nothing worked. Not downloaded, just reg streaming like I always do....
@SpotifyCares Her songs also got deleted from my playlists....
@SpotifyCares No. I uninstalled. I restarted phone. Logged out. Nothing helped. Will keep trying things.
@SpotifyCares Update: I just tried to play other albums by the same artist and got the same result
@SpotifyCares But that's it, I can add it to pl's and view artist etc just can't listen. 😳
@SpotifyCares Hey, it’s MacOS High Sierra 10.13 and Spotify 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares There’s no errors 😞

I click app &amp; it opens https://t.co/iU0eDkW2R1

I click to open a second time and app loads (without installing again)
@SpotifyCares Thank you! And one more question please. How many times (frequency) an ad appear in 1 hour?
@SpotifyCares I have research about Spotify. Can you tell me, what is Spotify exactly? Does Spotify part of social media, website, or an app?
@SpotifyCares I've already done that. It seems that it's like coming and going as it pleases.
@SpotifyCares It's a samsung galaxy s7 device with Android version 7.0 Nougat and I believe I'm using the latest version of Spotify.
@SpotifyCares “@115888 make it so you can disable this on desktop” -original tweet
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply🤙🏾

The people also miss synchronized lyrics🕺🏾
@SpotifyCares Done. Still going to the previous episode
@SpotifyCares This is the only device I use. Both on Wi-Fi and 3G/4G
@SpotifyCares Android 7.0
@SpotifyCares I'm using a noOk. The version is 6.0  it just stopped working
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Hope you noticed there was some sort of distortion with @127153's track. Might have to review the whole album if you have time too.
@SpotifyCares Hey RK/Content Team, any clue when you’ll solve the issue to @127153’s song?
@SpotifyCares Hey @117168 @SpotifyCares @127153 when are you going to fix this song?? It’s coming up on a month since I raise this issue to you..? #CustomerService
@SpotifyCares @127153 iOS 11.0.2, iPhone 6, Spotify version 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares @127153 @SpotifyCares You can even compare the quality versus his YouTube version.  @127153 https://t.co/fF22Ja041m
@SpotifyCares I already have an email thread with __email__ and I'd appreciate if someone replied. I also did the web form.
Also, let it be noted that @SpotifyCares is not helping me very quickly. Spotify doesn't have a customer service phone number which sucks.
@SpotifyCares It’s just the one song, not even the whole album
@SpotifyCares It’s set to the USA
@SpotifyCares Whatever the latest version is of both
@SpotifyCares let me know when you’ve got it done so i can start sharing music on twitter without the link again thanks ☺️
@SpotifyCares before updating to IOS 11 i wasn’t directed to twitter app everytime i want to share a song. i was very happy with the way it used to be :(
@SpotifyCares 6 days later and still not being able to share the song without having the link on the tweet. please do something about this asap
@SpotifyCares different places and I can't even sign in with just my email address. This shouldn't be so difficult. I haven't even started using the app–2
@SpotifyCares Make sure you use the word "Bonkers." :D Thanks for the response!
@SpotifyCares Clearing worked. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Here! 🌝 https://t.co/nkjUBpg7Nx
@SpotifyCares I'm on the latest version of Android version 8.0.0 my Spotify app is 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares It's the Google Pixel (1st Gen)
@SpotifyCares I just inboxed you guys on twitter
@SpotifyCares Spotify 1.0.64.399.g4637b02a; macOS 10.13
@SpotifyCares It seems to have helped somewhat. I will let you know if it happens again. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares I’m graduating in 2020 please can you check whether I am covered until then?
@SpotifyCares Ok so how do I swap it?
@SpotifyCares Yes but I already have an account
@SpotifyCares Shame, will switch to Tidal for the Hi Fi element then, it's pretty noticeable on my new player your  service has been great otherwise!
@SpotifyCares Voted. Thank you, how do I cancel my membership please?
@SpotifyCares so when can we expect fix ?
@SpotifyCares Seems to only be on chrome.

tried it on firefox and seems to be working fine for now
@SpotifyCares i mean, is there anything i can do to make it work on chrome? lol
@SpotifyCares chrome is up to date and it still happens
@SpotifyCares im not seeing any errors or anything like that.

its just me listening to a song, and then it just randomly skips it
@SpotifyCares clearing cache/cookies seems to have worked so far.
@SpotifyCares welp, nvm. keeps randomly skipping songs for no apparent reason...
@SpotifyCares still. even after ive done all this
@SpotifyCares Turns out it's my crappy @115858 headphones causing the problem. Nevermind!
@SpotifyCares Well, I tried using the headphones with iTunes and the same thing happened. Headphones are toast. Sad times. @115858
@SpotifyCares Lol k thanks for you recommendation.
@SpotifyCares That function isn't working either? Why did you remove the option to add a playlist to another playlist?
@SpotifyCares I've done it before lol
@SpotifyCares I've got about 5 different ones saved into one? Anyways forget it thanks for the help
@SpotifyCares Not a problem. Hopefully you'll fix it soon.
@SpotifyCares Hi there. I'll answer your survey once my request is fixed. I'd be really happy to see that you keep your word 😉
@SpotifyCares Yey you did it!Thanks a lot.Any luck that you can also include these albums by @15994? They were all released under @15992 https://t.co/p8ukBykH6a
@SpotifyCares sorry for slow device. latest version of Spotify on iPhone 4s
@SpotifyCares Can't see any sort option. Am I looking in the wrong place? https://t.co/jEaELwrRSF
@SpotifyCares I’m going to @115948 🙄
@SpotifyCares Ah that got it. I was confusing the two different icons (lines / dots). Thanks a lot, been wanting that for months.
@SpotifyCares Out and about at the mo - just tried to use my iPhone app and it's doing the same thing. Weird! Will give you deets when I'm back home.
@SpotifyCares You know when you call for tech support then everything magically starts working again? Yep, that happened so stand down! Thanks though 😅
@SpotifyCares Thanks, and of course - anything for my favorite streaming app
@SpotifyCares Just switched from a S7 to S8...Facebook login takes me to a nonpremium account that has none if my playlists, songs etc.
@SpotifyCares Problem fixed already. Thank you 😊
@SpotifyCares On top of that this has been going on for a month now. I tried it at the end of October with the same issue. I figured the website was down. So I thought I'd try again tonight with the same issue.
@SpotifyCares I am at home (Jazztel, Spain). On private browsing there is no difference, with uBlock disabled neither. Am I the only one unable to use it?
@SpotifyCares In Google Chrome I suppose it will work. Is there any problem with Firefox 56 (on Ubuntu), or have I broken something? :(
@SpotifyCares I understand the changes but I personally prefer how it worked before
@SpotifyCares Can you only download playlists on desktop and not your "song" list? The download slider appears for playlists
@SpotifyCares Can download song list on mobile so assumed it was possible on desktop.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply, it's appreciated! :)
@SpotifyCares Sure thing 😊 https://t.co/7b6vKpT0Nn
@SpotifyCares As far as I can tell,  it's only tracks by Bowie. Both locally saved &amp; streaming. Simply nothing happening when I tap on track name 😕
@SpotifyCares No error messages so far. Just inaction.
@SpotifyCares I am in UK
@SpotifyCares Will that be soon? Also can't find Disco Santa Claus by The Rain Dolls, despite that being on UK iTunes
@SpotifyCares Any news?!
@SpotifyCares Yes, but I am asking about the songs that aren't listed on UK spotify. Rain dolls are on iTunes uk
@SpotifyCares Any updates? Christmas time is fast approaching..
@SpotifyCares IE Rain Dolls - Disco Santa Claus, Rebecca Newman -Wonderful Dream, band aid 2 from 1989-do they know it's Christmas, Donna summer-Rosie Christmas, Cher -it's Christmas(baby please come home)
@SpotifyCares Sorry but I no longer believe you
@SpotifyCares Fingers crossed? How about saying whether you will make these tracks available or not. Stop with the weasel words! If you can't get any of these songs please say so, so I can cancel my subscription.
@SpotifyCares Also have apps on xbox1 and pc. Will check after work
@SpotifyCares Will try this after work .I'll keep ya posted ;)
@SpotifyCares I’m definitely looking forward to having the ability to search through my full library for a song, rather than only a playlist. I can’t imagine it would be tough for your programmers to do this so I assume it’s an executive decision for some unknow reason....
@SpotifyCares It connected later on. It's just that the error wasn't clearly visible to me. So, I think/hope the user interface can be improved there. 😉
@SpotifyCares none of those answers are appropriate, its a bug ive seen many complain about. so i just have to reinstall &amp; re save every 2 months? cool.
@SpotifyCares Yes, it works after I reinstall it, but the issue is that I have to keep doing this every 2 months. That is unacceptable
@SpotifyCares Here's a gif of the image (Slowed down immensely) And for me, it's frankly hard to look at! For some it could be much worse https://t.co/LdQxfa3kCZ
@SpotifyCares @202311 You can see it says "confirmation, about to join the family plan of..."
@SpotifyCares @202311 Getting the same error. It happens when I try to join a family plan after being invited. I am not the plan leader
@SpotifyCares 6 Plus with iOS 11.0.2; app 8.4.20.535. I often open the app whilst on Edge and the list of playlists doesn’t load (it remains blank)
@SpotifyCares They load eventually, been experiencing this for months, pre-iOS 11. Will try a hard reset
@SpotifyCares @202601 If your dev team need convincing, then you have a problem. It’s marketing who should decide on this. 🙄
@SpotifyCares Oh my bad. I got over excited. But thanks though!
@SpotifyCares Hey CB, I already have that! I was wondering if the new @115888 @115940 partnership benefits Starbucks Partners
@SpotifyCares Bummer! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Hi, yes it freezes my computer so i have to reboot it. I cant run the app on my laptop at all. Do i need to reinstall it again?
@SpotifyCares A hard reboot, because it doesnt react at all. It only happens when i use spotify
@SpotifyCares it started happening around june i guess, i cannot say when exactly. it only relates to my laptop, spotify app on my tablet works perfect
@SpotifyCares On me. It doesn't help if I turn off spotify app or leave it open, it freezes the whole computer, I can't move the mouse or do anything
@SpotifyCares Maybe there is a way of stopping automatic update. Seriously, im getting tired of this problem
@SpotifyCares I have win10 and I cannot check spotify version because it all freezes. Tablet app working fine. Any help or is it Windows fault?
@SpotifyCares Thank you! Will do! I have Spotify on probably 40-50 hours/week so it's well-loved!
@SpotifyCares Fb messenger will do I suppose! Thank you
@SpotifyCares @115888 please some consideration?
@SpotifyCares Hi, please some assistance. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I was able to do that, but how do I clear all the tracks at once? I'm pretty sure there used to be a button for that.
@SpotifyCares Nope. There's no Clear button on the desktop app.
@SpotifyCares I hate it, Spotify. I love you and have loved you for years but this is UGLY. Why did you do this to me I honestly can't understand it
@SpotifyCares Do you guys have an idea of when playlists will be back on roku? I don't have any of the other devices. Just roku and my phone.
@SpotifyCares Perfect. 😍
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, iOS 11.0.3, Spotify version 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares I already tried that *TWICE*
@SpotifyCares 3/ Other times, the app signs itself out. I had to reinstall all music onto my device once.
@SpotifyCares Great. But the whole thing seems designed to push people toward passive playlist listening instead of active exploration. 1/
@SpotifyCares Design to delight the music nerd and you'll make a lot more music nerds AND regular active consumers.
@SpotifyCares Neither worked
@SpotifyCares I never saw the message I received in my dm and now I cannot forward on my issue. Can I reopen my case
@SpotifyCares Samsung Galaxy A5, Android 7.0, Version 8.4.22.857 armV7
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/p0mO24Dak6 Ireland
@SpotifyCares I just did that and restarted my phone and it started working! Thank you :)
@SpotifyCares Thank you. Not sure how 2600 songs ended on shuffle, but I turned off Autoplay.
@SpotifyCares nope, still https://t.co/KjibrUYwtZ
@SpotifyCares 8.4.18.632
@SpotifyCares So is the Queue deleted when I play a new playlist now? I guess the iPad must be restarted when updated because that icon was not there?
@SpotifyCares MacBook Pro (OS High Sierra), iPhone 6s Plus (iOS 11.2) and the latest versions of Spotify. Keeps crashing on my Mac and won’t sync any of..
@SpotifyCares ..the playlists I’ve made on my Mac to my phone (even though the playlists show on my phone, just without any content in)..
@SpotifyCares This should have like 10 songs in as on my Mac, but they don’t seem to appear on my iPhone https://t.co/cc2vqQgN9e
@SpotifyCares I’ve tried that.. 🙄
@SpotifyCares Yes to both
@SpotifyCares Yay thank you!
@SpotifyCares OnePlus X, Android 7.1. Spotify versión: 8.4.22.857 armV7.
The region would be Latin America.
@SpotifyCares This happens only on the phone. Just checked on my computer and I'm able to listen to these songs.
@SpotifyCares Some times  toast notification shows displaying "This song is not available", most of the time nothing shows.
@SpotifyCares It only happens to some of the songs, also happens on songs while trying to listen to them online.
@SpotifyCares Sure. I can select any song on that album as an example and nothing happens. https://t.co/obvT36rSjc
@SpotifyCares nope i was just jammin out and boom - there were no crashes and the app didnt close
@SpotifyCares yep
@SpotifyCares Premium. How do I upgrade to a Petty Premium that only plays Tom Petty? I don’t need any additional music (except maybe traveling Wilburys)
@SpotifyCares 8.4.20.535 on an iPhone 7 with iOS 11.0.2
@SpotifyCares Cell or a cached playlist. I mainly notice this during Carplay (connect thru USB) or car Bluetooth. I refresh my Twitter TL and it pauses
@SpotifyCares I'll report tomorrow when I get back in my car. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares This may be an @AppleSupport issue. The native podcast app also pauses when refreshing social media BUT it plays again. Spotify stays paused
@SpotifyCares Just did. Same result 😞
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response!
@SpotifyCares Problem fixed, thanks for responding though.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your reply!
@SpotifyCares thank you so much I just completed it. 🙏🏽🙏🏽
@SpotifyCares Windows 10, 1.0.62.510.g918a790c (Windows Store version).
@SpotifyCares Sorry I just noticed there was an update so it's now, 1.0.64.403.gb738707f (Windows Store version)
@SpotifyCares Sure!
@SpotifyCares I logged out, restarted my Mac, and logged back in and still no change sadly
@SpotifyCares Oh I understand! Okay thank you! 😔
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares I've reinstalled. Soft reset.
@SpotifyCares I've shared music many times daily with a very special someone for almost a year. Very sad that can't happen now.
@SpotifyCares Have @115948  @GooglePlayMusic @129941 had sharing crash their apps 4 days consecutively? #timetoswitch #whowantsmymoney
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares I never stated how I feel. That response proves you don't read your customers responses.
@SpotifyCares Any ETA on the ongoing app crashing via sharing song issue? Approaching a week without a resolution. What am I paying for? Please credit me!
@SpotifyCares How long do your customers have to suffer due to outages before they are compensated?
@SpotifyCares No srsly how much did that spotify package deal cost pls
@SpotifyCares Check inbox i explained what happened. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Yes for streaming music recently, no for private session.
@SpotifyCares Nope
@SpotifyCares it says im offline on the desktop app but im connected to the wifi...and for the webplayer it’s stuck on an ad that wont play...
@SpotifyCares nope :/
@SpotifyCares it worked ! thank you
@SpotifyCares Spotify app = 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
iOS = Sierra 10.12.6
@SpotifyCares That worked! Thank you!
@SpotifyCares For the record, it’s an iMac, using the desktop app, worked just fine till I updated a day or two ago.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/ERLxIw0uMA
@SpotifyCares 5.1 and I think this is the 2nd time it happened or was aware of
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares Oh, I hope it’s resolved soon. Thank you for answering
@SpotifyCares Why isn’t Broke with expensive taste by Azealia Banks available anymore? Did she or Spotify take it down or is it my phone?
@SpotifyCares thanks I'm chatting with a representative at the moment :)
@SpotifyCares Like I want all my music beyond 9900 to be moved to a single playlist. And not to mention that the Windows Phone app cannot be started.
@SpotifyCares thanks, always appreciate it :)
@SpotifyCares It's almost impossible to seize through all the extra junk that passes off as official albums!
@SpotifyCares Smartphone Android 6, 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares No, it doesn't. The songs are not available in desktop version of app also. https://t.co/4nvtIepxGU
@SpotifyCares So after two years it goes back to normal price ?
@SpotifyCares Oh, sure! Thanks!!!
@SpotifyCares Why can't I play the song? 😧
@SpotifyCares OoooooOOOO thx fam!!
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares I connect via Bluetooth.  Restarting makes no difference.  I also have Bluetooth headphones that shuffle fine when connected.
@SpotifyCares I tried that and it still has the same problem
@SpotifyCares It still didn’t work for me.
@SpotifyCares Spotify version 8.4.20. Car is a 2013 Mazda CX-5
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares ohhh so do you think it's possible they re-uploaded the album with english titles?
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/XYQtNwzM2e the titles used to be in japanese but when they changed to english it got removed from my playlists D: same for all
@SpotifyCares Superman album, it was removed from all my playlists and when i found it again the titles were now english)
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Also one other question - sometimes songs get removed from my playlists (i noticed this with all od wednesday campanellas
@SpotifyCares Doesn’t seems to change ☹️ https://t.co/9VppbaLyNI
@SpotifyCares Yep, nothing changes. Main chart page shows in English, but when click in it’s in Bahasa. https://t.co/26Ka7dG2q8
@SpotifyCares hey, nothing changed after i log out &gt; restart &gt; log back in
@SpotifyCares it actually got charged twice
@SpotifyCares Thx. In the end it was not your app but @118197 laptop having issues probably after some recent Windows update. Sound card driver upd. helped
@SpotifyCares OK thanks. If i cancel it now, is it cancel immediately or until the end of my subscription?
@SpotifyCares ...then it's suddenly not downloaded anymore.
@SpotifyCares What is the "Stranger Things" mode in the settings ?
@SpotifyCares Oh OK ! Lol 😝
@SpotifyCares I keyed in the same address.
@SpotifyCares Safe
@SpotifyCares Thank you guys 🤗🎤💜🎼
@SpotifyCares Wow, Spotify really does care 😪thank you!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8plus/iOS 11.0.2. It never used to do it and I’ve tried going through the settings for an option but I can’t see one
@SpotifyCares 8.4.20, my app updates itself, no it’s happening in my own playlist and in the pre made ones too 😩
@SpotifyCares It didn’t work. Seems to be when I plug it into my usb to play in my car
@SpotifyCares I'm an Apple Music user sweetie I just want the tea on JLo's Spotify sessions
@SpotifyCares almost a full year now and still the same problem, im really disappointed from you guys
@SpotifyCares When I close the app and enter it again it works but after a week it happens again
@SpotifyCares 3G and WiFi even though I have premium
@SpotifyCares Hasn’t done it in a week or two
@SpotifyCares No
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s and version 8.4.20
@SpotifyCares Sending a fm
@SpotifyCares Hi! I see in the "Subscription" that my account is still associated with the Partner Arnet, can you check if they renewed my subscription?
@SpotifyCares It happens in the Discover Weekly playlist so I kinda understand why it happens since I'm now in Bulgaria :)
@SpotifyCares yes boo
@SpotifyCares thanks
@SpotifyCares Spotify premium! It's on my smartphone using the App (iphone 6s)
@SpotifyCares I also tried restarting my phone and doing a hard reset, but still no change
@SpotifyCares Nope, no errors. I got the app to work, but the web player refuses to start.
@SpotifyCares Tried all that. Not working. The App is working fine after I turned off the hardware enhanced option.
@SpotifyCares Did that. I'll try it again.
@SpotifyCares Cleared cookies and cache, still not playing.
@SpotifyCares That was quick! I tweeted Microsoft 7 days ago and nothing. Nice work on your customer service! https://t.co/C970GJvJ3h
@SpotifyCares So in other words... Not anytime soon. @115948 here I come.
@SpotifyCares Safe
@SpotifyCares Ah sorted, many thanks!
@SpotifyCares @83197 @115890 @115888 @SpotifyCares - Shame on u all for making groove music customers move to this unusable app! #premiumuser
@SpotifyCares If you check the error logs under the windows phone app analytics, you will see the error coming up. Im not only one with the problem
@SpotifyCares I reset my password as soon as I noticed so I'm good, but I don't have my saved music, is there a way to restore the albums I have saved?
@SpotifyCares no, they're literally all gone. not even saved to my account anymore.
@SpotifyCares No error message; the app simply closes. I tried restarting my device but it still has the glitch.
@SpotifyCares Steps followed, glitch persists.
@SpotifyCares Thank youu
@SpotifyCares The rest of the list is great but I can’t wait for you to add a “never play this artist again” button.
@SpotifyCares I have all that but it still says connect to facebook.
@SpotifyCares As in log out and sign in with facebook?
@SpotifyCares Nevermind. I fixed it by unfollowing and refollowing him
@SpotifyCares Just tried it. Still not working
@SpotifyCares Every time I click on a song it says that it is unavailable. It's only doing this for Kendrick on mobile as far as I know https://t.co/uz39Yg7s42
@SpotifyCares .@115888 @SpotifyCares I just got email incorrectly saying it was fixed. It's not! Please mark it as not fixed. https://t.co/yG7PBtu6id
@SpotifyCares . @SpotifyCares @115888 any updates or tracking number or ANYTHING on this? This issue keeps getting comments, and all we see is tumbleweed
@SpotifyCares .@SpotifyCares @115888 Good question "Is anyone from Spotify actually reading customer's feedbacks?" Are they? https://t.co/7zrN5a3I2F
@SpotifyCares Could you get someone to read thru the comments at that link (4 pgs!)? User accidentally disliking a song and no way to reverse it. Sucks!
@SpotifyCares I’ll let know if this keeps going after a day of use. It usually resets after a day.
@SpotifyCares I actually may have just fixed it by disabling Apple Music.
@SpotifyCares I’ve also done a complete phone restart and reinstalled everything. Unfortunately still disappearing from the control center.
@SpotifyCares Ive uninstalled the app, restarted phone, and reinstalled which fixes it briefly but then reverts after a short while.
@SpotifyCares Because Spotify doesn’t show, I’m not able to pause with my AirPods or control with Car Play. I can play and pause in-app though.
@SpotifyCares Hey! Since the iOS 11 update, I haven’t been able to use controls for Spotify in the Control Center or lock screen. https://t.co/pXnDQLooQr
@SpotifyCares I’m using a MacBook Air, macOS Sierra (10.12.6) &amp; the latest version of Spotify (1.0.65.320). I’ve tried clearing the storage cache as well.
@SpotifyCares I’m just on WiFi.
@SpotifyCares I’m at uni right now, so I’m with their ISP, it’s been the same back home with my ISP, so yes I’ve been on different networks.
@SpotifyCares It doesn’t no, I don’t think it’s an issue with my computer. I’ve seen online that other people’s recently played doesn’t update as well.
@SpotifyCares No I don’t use a private session, I think it’s not updating with a server or something, that’s why there’s artists I don’t listen to on it.
@SpotifyCares Just sent you a DM
@SpotifyCares i'm using the web player on a Chromebook
@SpotifyCares no i dont have an error message
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/EQg8cbOJT8
@SpotifyCares sorry but my school laptop wont let me make an incognito window
@SpotifyCares its still stuck
@SpotifyCares i was listening to a song that was not previously greyed out, now i cant click on another song to play and it wont play the one i'm stuck on
@SpotifyCares Ah good to know. This feels like something that should definitely be in. Poor targeting just annoys people. :)
@SpotifyCares Just did both and still stuck on that same southern comfort ad :(
@SpotifyCares yes, in my about page it says up to day, specifically "Version 61.0.3163.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)" if that helps~
@SpotifyCares Just tried with an incognito and logs into the same issue, it's still stuck on southern comfort ad forever 😂, thanks for keeping up w/ this
@SpotifyCares I don't have firefox but i did try it on Edge and it's the same issue, so it doesn't seem to be chrome specific
@SpotifyCares On tap it shows the highlight, nothing happens afterwards. Only plays song nr5 though that one is on Michael Jackson's name 😉. Anything JT refuses to play 😭😉 https://t.co/bzwNd0gbtg
@SpotifyCares What I would like is for my public facing name, or username in every other application, to be Zucce05 (Just like everything else I have).
@SpotifyCares Oh, I can't stream them from my cloud? I'm being forced off groove, and am looking for equal capability. Offline playlist for dual cloud.
@SpotifyCares you have a great shuffle going on here...
@SpotifyCares Hey thanks a lot! I’m using an iPhone 7 and IOS 11.0.2
@SpotifyCares That worked! Simple enough lol thanks!
@SpotifyCares Great!  Its the version on the "12" 80s Pop" album - the embedded one above appears to sound fine. 😃 https://t.co/h3koA2gkHH
@SpotifyCares Just get email verification
@SpotifyCares LOL I dont have a Spotofy acct. Your service sends me email that somebody else typoed, you need email verification.
@SpotifyCares I'm not going to send you that email address. Your domains already filtered, I wont see Spotofy mail again. USE EMAIL VERIFICATION.
@SpotifyCares I understand. Annoying that I had to download the app to find out though. There was no hint of it from the Google search.
@SpotifyCares @115888 Oops. Already deleted the app! It was 'Vs Time' by Span. My country was set to UK.
@SpotifyCares Says everyone plays ther own but is that in online mode aswell as offline
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares Thanks Bae ❤️
@SpotifyCares ok, I'll wait for it then, thanks anyway 🙏
@SpotifyCares Done it already thanks ;)
@SpotifyCares haha I love you guys
@SpotifyCares Thanks! No error message, I just press PLAY but nothing happens. I've tried it on other artists as well and I get the same issue
@SpotifyCares I'm using Windows 10 on a Toshiba Satellite Pro. Spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares It happened both at work and at home, so both private networks. Just tried it on my Mac and it works - not sure it helps.
@SpotifyCares I've restarted the computer and uninstalled Spotify but the problem remains. When I try to play one specific song it says it's not available
@SpotifyCares Could it be because I activated the Premium trial and it just went back to the free version?
@SpotifyCares The XX and alt-j I can't. I've tried others (e.g. Jamie XX and Broken Bells) and there was no issue
@SpotifyCares I'll def send a screenshot if it happens again. There's no error message. Music stops, I check the page, it is the "sign up" or "login" page
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/fspZVSZuMF
@SpotifyCares Thanks,unchecking "Devices lock screen" has made huge difference,shame lose home screen control. Working on a fix for that?
@SpotifyCares Just happened it's a Target ad for something about Goodfellow &amp; Co. https://t.co/Lz4xvnRjHy
@SpotifyCares I don't use other devices for spotify often. I haven't noticed it though.
@SpotifyCares It's not every video ad, only certain ones. Could be the video format maybe? Next time it sticks I'll see if I can tell what the ad is for.
@SpotifyCares I think it is for video ads. The video doesn't display or play and the app is just grayed out. Gotta close and reopen to play more music.
@SpotifyCares im using apple mac and iphone and there all up to date
@SpotifyCares Yeah I’ve been checking but I can’t see them!
@SpotifyCares That's actually what I was thinking about and looking for. Great help, thanks!
@SpotifyCares ily but I find it hard to see what the long hold feature could be used for besides previewing the song
@SpotifyCares Android
@SpotifyCares Android version 7.0, Spotify 8.4.22.857 arm v7  no it just opens but every single night doesn't play music though. Just annoying 😂😂
@SpotifyCares I'll try it today and see if that works. Many thanks
@SpotifyCares She was part of my family group but not now, I’m the owner of the account my name should be there. Thanks in advance! Hope you can help me
@SpotifyCares I would like to be refunded and to make sure this stops happening. My device is the OnePlus 3T. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/rcpDwXftqS
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/k3xLDF0tKk
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response. Unfortunately I’ve already read that and am just begging for it back like everyone on that thread.
@SpotifyCares That didn’t help
@SpotifyCares Using two devices: Macbook Pro OS High Sierra version 10.13, and iPhone 7 Plus 11.0.3.
@SpotifyCares ... previously-played songs. Sorry for the multiple tweets, it's difficult to explain all my thoughts in 140 characters.
@SpotifyCares Noooooo! Please help, I use it for my classes and I pay for premium and now groups like Avicii wont play!
@SpotifyCares Bruno Mars,  Elli Goulding, etc
@SpotifyCares desktop computer samsung galaxy j1
@SpotifyCares cool, good changes, but this doesn't change that songs added to a playlist more recently get shuffle preference over other songs added first
@SpotifyCares For a whole album, I can see that. But why just one or two songs from an album. Hopefully my music comes back soon, don’t want to change
@SpotifyCares i'm in Portugal right now
@SpotifyCares No problem, thanks for the help!
@SpotifyCares no matter what New Order song I try to play I get "song is not available" https://t.co/degqDX0zzz
@SpotifyCares Windows: 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02

App: 8.4.22.857armV7
@SpotifyCares it finally showed up again, here ya go. https://t.co/nEBC58Mvns
@SpotifyCares Galaxy S7 android 7.0
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 Plus, running 11.0.2. currently the log in screen just says "Log In" at the top, and the running intro video loop
@SpotifyCares It takes ~5 minutes between pressing “Log In” and getting to that screen. Then it holds there, with the video looping. Reinstalled twice
@SpotifyCares I figured out a fix after this happening a few times: go back to main screen, press Log In again: correct screen loads
@SpotifyCares Literally, it's go back a page, go forward again.
@SpotifyCares Yes. I logged out &amp; shut down app. It took ten minutes to blank log in screen + additional blank screens for every time I hit "Log In"...
@SpotifyCares ...after that: I had to hit "back" button many times to get to original screen, pressed Log In, that worked. Log Out w/o App quit is normal
@SpotifyCares I see no reason to un/reinstall the application on desktop or continue to test this on different networks. Problem began with new mobile app
@SpotifyCares Moto E4 Plus Android // Windows 10.
@SpotifyCares I’m still having this issue. It seems others are too based on this forum thread. Are your app devs working on it? They need to fix it ASAP. I’m paying for premium, and It’s very annoying not to be able to shuffle! https://t.co/IUQzW3btdO
@SpotifyCares I have Spotify premium, version 8.4.24.506. I make sure to select shuffle, but it just deselects and goes to the next alphabetical artist.
@SpotifyCares Yes I was I didn’t have a choice to skip it
@SpotifyCares No it’s just it’s very misleading saying 30 mins ad free music and only getting through 3 songs
@SpotifyCares Thanks spotify 😢👌🏻
@SpotifyCares when i change my playlist cover art on my computer it doesn’t change or update it on my phone ;;(
@SpotifyCares can i dm you? i can’t fit it all in one tweet !
@SpotifyCares Vizio E320i-B2 pls bring it back I hate pandora
@SpotifyCares Well will you buy me a new tv that does have your app then? -a poor nursing student
@SpotifyCares dang y’all quick💀 you really care omg😂💕💕💕💕💕
@SpotifyCares Rebooting doesn't help but my friend has the same issue with his spotify app on his Roku
@SpotifyCares It's a Roku 3!
@SpotifyCares Sure! This is the page on which the album is currently located... https://t.co/DlfEEYCSfN
@SpotifyCares And this is the page it should be on: https://t.co/x6pSK3bnhh
@SpotifyCares I'm using macOS Sierra ver 10.12 and my current Spotify version is 1.0.64.399.g4637b02a
@SpotifyCares I did and updated to version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 and it's still the same
@SpotifyCares Good looks my guy
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/RsXyJGwkTF
@SpotifyCares I can't remove the battery, but let me try it.
@SpotifyCares It didn't work out, let me clear the problem is just with certain songs of that specific album, I don't have trouble playing other songs.
@SpotifyCares On Android 7.0 https://t.co/ayM1xQ0uLf
@SpotifyCares Hey thanks for replying so fast I don't get any message it just won't play.
@SpotifyCares Can't log into the app on my PC laptop. The mobile app is working fine.
@SpotifyCares So with all the complaints still you're not bringing it or something just like it back?
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.857? I think.
@SpotifyCares armV7
@SpotifyCares Dm sent
@SpotifyCares It's been 2 years since someone had this idea, and Spotify still hasn't implemented it. Support this!
@SpotifyCares I used facebook to sign in before and now when I try logging in, it doesn't let me sign in with my facebook password nor my facebook itself.
@SpotifyCares The first one is using my password, and the other is using facebook. I'm currently using a browser to login to my account. https://t.co/AyU4PaUGpN
@SpotifyCares spotify:track:1fUltGShGtBYSq4D7Rv9Az
@SpotifyCares I’ll try and work it out cheers mate
@SpotifyCares No nothing like that just like the old cds that use to skip all the time
@SpotifyCares Yep 11.0.2
@SpotifyCares Using an IPhone 7 and the most updated Spotify.
@SpotifyCares U mean to tell me you got rid of an actual USEFUL feature but didn’t get rid of the “star” feature which is practically obsolete
@SpotifyCares thanks.
@SpotifyCares The app only has the top tracks it doesn’t let me access my Library, nor the playlist I’ve created. I have to basically search each song
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/CuYjs4qT5b
@SpotifyCares I've done all of that. The only albums Spotify won't stream are #DemiLovato
@SpotifyCares Spotify still won't play #DemiLovato. The problem effects all of her albums.
@SpotifyCares No luck. Still doesn't play Demi Lovato. I'm not switching outputs to cause it.
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Galaxy 8 and the latest app update for Spotify. Everytime I play a Demi Lovato song, it says it's unavailable.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/ZqcRFT7EO5
@SpotifyCares I have done that numerous times before. It happens regardless. The only way I can access Spotify back is by opening the app again which sux
@SpotifyCares Unistalled, redownloaded and logged back in now. What next?
@SpotifyCares @3493 Now it simply disappeared, so I can only access it by opening the app manually
@SpotifyCares Yes, the lock screen menu on mobile, the same as the pulldown notifications menu.
@SpotifyCares @3493 Is that normal? I switch a lot between devices, whether it be car, different headphones or other computers
@SpotifyCares If it happens again...
@SpotifyCares ...media. Had been happening with my previous Xperia Z2 as well. What's the fix plz?
@SpotifyCares why are we voting on an idea that you promised us already
@SpotifyCares Pixel. Spotify version 8.4.22.857 arm V7
Thank you :)
@SpotifyCares Any luck??
@SpotifyCares You're a real one! Just posted from my phone ✊ Thank you!
@SpotifyCares No just albums.
@SpotifyCares hi there thanks for the gr8 service! odd eye circle’s album has been added like 20 mins ago to spotify u guys rock🔥🔥🔥
@SpotifyCares It’s HS 10.13 (17A405). No other tracks have varied so wildly, I’m putting it down to a full-range mix (nice but unusual) - thanks anyway.
@SpotifyCares It was this track https://t.co/ySw6Nx26Be inside a daily-mix list.
@SpotifyCares It’s also had some upper EQ or Spectralizer added during the mix to push the high freqs I think. Quite like it.
@SpotifyCares Can’t do that at the mo - am at work :)
@SpotifyCares Thanks, stats should be fixed by now, always a bit late on Monday ;) Will reach to enable the radio to @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Emailed but the answer was vague with no real action items... so will continue to do what I do and eventually it will happen...
@SpotifyCares Using an iPhone 7 Plus. When I select a particular artist from a playlist I’ve made it doesn’t carry on to the next song it plays a random 1
@SpotifyCares It is only when I narrow down to say a particular artist from a playlist I’ve made. If I play through the whole playlist it doesn’t do it
@SpotifyCares It happens when I listen to my downloaded music. Version 8.4.20
@SpotifyCares Also I just have the latest version
@SpotifyCares Hey,
seems to be an issue with the latest Chrome version on OSX.
Restarting Chrome fixes everything.
Thanks, and have a great day!
@SpotifyCares -&gt; directly on WIndows it doesn't happen.
Same if I play directly on the Mac.
It ONLY happens if you remote control...
@SpotifyCares POSSIBLY this might be, I just realised, because my Mac is remote controlling Spotify on my Windows machine. When I control Spotify -&gt;
@SpotifyCares This begins a few hundred songs down in the playlist. Seriously annoying.
@SpotifyCares My crush did not reply my text. 🙇🏻
@SpotifyCares Can you point me to any specifics regarding what the web player requires to work? Special ports, UPNP requirement etc?
@SpotifyCares I have tried in Chrome and IE. I'm behind a corporate proxy that disallows pretty much everything except http/https. It also SSL-offloads.
@SpotifyCares A list of requirements would be great so I could give _something_ to our network team. Right now they have nothing to go on!
@SpotifyCares The point is: what exactly is that exception.  Without knowing what Spotify needs I can't tell them what to change.
@SpotifyCares This makes no sense, it does not improve my experience, this eliminates my experience.
@SpotifyCares at least add her "the high road" album back
@SpotifyCares please don't make me cry 😪😪😪
@SpotifyCares How can you call that improvements? Everyone in that thread is complaining.
@SpotifyCares I already talked with someone from Spotify support and it’s fixed, thanks
@SpotifyCares cool, thanks heaps! keep up the good work !
@SpotifyCares thanks, but the vote button says "sorry you can't like this post" ? and it's under consideration since 10 months back?
@SpotifyCares Thanks! We've already solve it 😊
@SpotifyCares macOS 1.0.63.617.g5aca9a2a. Used to get a dropdown w/ results I could navigate w/ cursor keys. Now it's an inline thing I have to tab thru
@SpotifyCares Most of the time when you tab over there's not even a visual indicator of what's selected, which is extra frustrating
@SpotifyCares You rock. Thanks a lot!
.@SpotifyCares I'm not buying it. Sounds like an automated or just canned response. What do I need help with? Can it be minimised to tray?
@SpotifyCares Haha, just a very annoying song in this weeks “discover weekly”, which got stuck on my mind 😉
@SpotifyCares I had to take this via Instagram story (so the music would keep playing while recording) apologies for bad quality. https://t.co/XXuntNo4OF
@SpotifyCares Started doing it again yesterday. However, the same issue occurs when I use iTunes now, so, it must be an iOS problem.
@SpotifyCares Yeah I’ve been back and fourth taking to customer service. They have told me they would email me back on those such occasions
@SpotifyCares it's one direction
@SpotifyCares I doubt it
@SpotifyCares can u give me a premium acc on spotify
@SpotifyCares gago di mo ba alam na ang mahal ng premium niyo pwe
@SpotifyCares and i will never ever get a credit card, those are devil work XD ...
but it is ok, i live in a third world country so i used to ...
@SpotifyCares yep, it is a little detail on your great service ... maybe someday you could put those ad based in music taste and not in ip like others ad
@SpotifyCares I'm about to stop using Spotify because it's the only commercial I get anymore and there's no apparent option to switch ad genres
@SpotifyCares hm, that was actually a compliment: you nailed the update experience! I’m totally happy 👏
@SpotifyCares I'm sure you'll have it in no time! I'm thankful you have arcade fire since I'm seeing them in a month, I need to brush up!
@SpotifyCares I'm seeing this error message on Window 7 Spotify desktop application -- it works fine on iOS app https://t.co/MTBrihvcHn
@SpotifyCares It's the heading for the "browse" section. It's in both Chinese and English because HK is bilingual. But it should be in Traditional Chinese
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply
@SpotifyCares Ok. Thanks for your support!
@SpotifyCares When I use my smartphone all the songs are correctly synchronized to my last.fm account. That issue started happen after Spotify Web updated
@SpotifyCares I'm listening to my songs in Spotify Web in my notebook Lenovo, Windows 10, Google Chrome. The songs are not appearing in my last.fm account
@SpotifyCares Payment. Have a new card
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares HiFi is not that hard,  but if it's not comming I'm off to Tidal
@SpotifyCares Seems to be working now
@SpotifyCares OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 - to be clear.
@SpotifyCares I've logged out/logged in and restarted my computer. Nothing is working. https://t.co/1KoV5D2oLu
@SpotifyCares Followed these directions and reinstalled. Still not working.
@SpotifyCares My university network! I even tried using vpn &amp; it still wont work.
@SpotifyCares This appears to have solved the issue for now. I will be in touch if I experience any further problems. Thank you! (cc: @AppleSupport)
@SpotifyCares I do appreciate your time. When it comes to assisting customers, I know... https://t.co/UvC9TMAnFs
@SpotifyCares Hey, this issue is happening again. That refresh didn’t do the trick a day later.
@SpotifyCares I will perform this troubleshooting method later today and let you know
@SpotifyCares Spotify controls aren’t available from my lock screen so my car just plays from my Apple Music
@SpotifyCares I have an Apple iPhone 7Plus running iOS 11.0.2 and my Spotify is 8.4.20
@SpotifyCares I don't even know what Connect is, JP. It's the desktop app. I'm not on mobile long enough to see if it does it there, too.
@SpotifyCares Sierra and 1.0.65 -- I don't think it's a bug. I just think it's part of your algorithm.
@SpotifyCares Yeah, pretty much.
@SpotifyCares When I click a song nothing happens and the “shuffle” button shakes... I’ve recorded my screen to you... https://t.co/WWnqUChp5k
@SpotifyCares Thank you - just sent it
@SpotifyCares Thanks! iPhone 7, iOS 11.0.1, Spotify version  below. :) https://t.co/qLOICoNktS
@SpotifyCares But then stops music the whole time I'm on twitter, not just when scrolling past videos. Bit annoying :(
@SpotifyCares I only use spotify on my Samsung phone. I have the current version 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares Yeah it's happening with all the songs. 
https://t.co/R0xxnLpqaR
@SpotifyCares Its strange I can't put any of her songs in a queue either. But I'm listening to metallica now just fine
@SpotifyCares Yes, but nothing changed. When i try to share music on twitter, application automatically opens and looks like this. It was seemed with album cover before. https://t.co/zIlSs7wz8x
@SpotifyCares It was not like this before updating my phone to ios11. I use 8.4.20.535 version of Spotify
@SpotifyCares I've tried that
@SpotifyCares XD sorry I don't have one of those either.
@SpotifyCares I've done that, it hasn't been helping. I noticed it doesn't stay in offline mode either.
@SpotifyCares Mm still has it a bit, but I still love your app! Maybe it doesn't like launching....that's where I find the lag most frequently is booting up the app.
@SpotifyCares Spotify version: 8.4.28.875 armV7
Android 7.0
@SpotifyCares Thank you🤗
@SpotifyCares I need these changes implemented immediately.
@SpotifyCares I do NOT want to see her face or hear her stupid big bird voice come out of me phone. I am on anti depressants bc of her.
@SpotifyCares I signed up for premium and I got 30 days. I don't think I have ever been with Spotify. Transferring from Groove.
@SpotifyCares Don't worry I got it figured out in the end! :)
@SpotifyCares Ok but before I do is all caps a requirement or just a suggestion I want to maximize my chances
@SpotifyCares Unless I have an external HDD plugged into my mac, which DOES have the tracks on. But how would that by syncing to my mob?
@SpotifyCares Maybe? The track isn't on my mobile (iPhone 6 - iOS 10.3.3) or my Macbook. Works on mob but not Mac
@SpotifyCares Hmm that seems completely different? I dont want to import local files, I just want to know why some files play on my mobile and not desktop
@SpotifyCares There's no downloaded playlists on my mobile so I don't see how it could be local on there anyway
@SpotifyCares Only the "This song is not available ... import it" at the top. Just checked and it plays from web Spotify just fine. I have an idea
@SpotifyCares My thoughts were correct. The desktop app seems to favour local files over streaming.  I've got the song on a HDD which my iTunes lib is on
@SpotifyCares If that HDD is plugged in it works fine, if it's not I get the error. BUT, if I turn off local files it plays fine without the HDD
@SpotifyCares Seems as if Spotify is not falling back to the streamed version if it can't find a local file on the desktop app.
@SpotifyCares Weird because I'm playing from the artist profile so I thought it'd prioritise streamed &gt; local to get the "Correct" artist version
@SpotifyCares Who knows, anyway a fix for this would be lovely as I don't always carry my HDD and it's annoying not being able to play songs ☺️
@SpotifyCares Thanks God, everything is ok, enjoying good music ;)
Just a random thought, usually I like to setup 2FA on all services I use.
@SpotifyCares sent DM! Cheers
@SpotifyCares It's set up on Google Home. The app is also on my smartphone, but a rarely open it.
@SpotifyCares I have never used another device for playback, just my cluster of Google Homes and Chromecast.
@SpotifyCares LInk provided does not help. Want others songs to play after requesting a specific song, currently it plays the requested song and stops.
@SpotifyCares Several Spotify customers were genuinely concerned that they had been hacked and your solution was to ignore their questions. Not very good is it?
@SpotifyCares Your own @117153 account alerted people that there are issues. I don’t understand why you’re forbidden from acknowledging that.
@SpotifyCares Running from my Samsung s7, android version 7.0, and running Spotify v.8.4.26.770
@SpotifyCares This has helped... For now!
When this problem occurs, are there any other ways to fix it without having to turn my decide off?
@SpotifyCares So this problem has continually happened for the past 4 days, and I'm a little sick of restarting my phone in order for Spotify to work. Any more suggestions???
@SpotifyCares Uninstalled and reinstalled. Going well so far. Will report back 🤙
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares MAS AMORE TEM NO SPOTIFY EU QUERO NA PLAYLIST
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.1.2 and Spotify app version 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares Seems to have worked, thank you!
@SpotifyCares When i hit the play button nothing happens at all. It stopped in the middle of a song.
@SpotifyCares Thank you buy i got it fixed.
@SpotifyCares Thanks alot, been happening quite a bit lately so was wondering if it was on my end or on yours, Thanks and have a nice day 😉
@SpotifyCares it was sending me back to the login page even though I logged in with the right credentials. But it is fixed now :) thanks!
@SpotifyCares It's working now as well from the Spotify app!
@SpotifyCares @221335 'we don't have any info on this'? Wtf? You are Spotify aren't you?
@SpotifyCares Yeah, they marked it “not right now” 😕
@SpotifyCares It’s not letting me purchase premium with any of my cards😑 help would be appreciated 👌🏻
@SpotifyCares I’m not from US/UK. Is there any way you can help now?
@SpotifyCares I’m in India.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response, hope India will be soon in your list.
@SpotifyCares Hi, AU. Ryan O in the SPotify chat fixed my issue. Thanks so much for your reply. Have a great day!
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much for your quick help
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+. 11.0.2 and spotify is updated
@SpotifyCares Thanks but it's not a bug, it's a feature. The shortcut is great for easily skipping songs on album view but if you happen to be in list view you'll remove songs from your library with no option to undo. iPhone 7 Plus iOS 10.2.1 Spotify version 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares I think a lot of people experienced the same outage. I think we're back to normal now.
@SpotifyCares It seems to have resolved itself.   I could hit the website but login would just never complete
@SpotifyCares Thanks for getting bck.
Yes its the most recent available vrsn via Google play.
Previous also did the same for short period. But seem to resolve.
With recent update its bck with vengeance.
Have also de/re-installed the app.
No avail.
@SpotifyCares Cool that seemed to do the trick for now. Whole song, no skip.
Thank you!
Zee
@SpotifyCares also, when i try to connect my hulu account it does not allow me to
@SpotifyCares iPhone. But the problem is with my account I want to manage the accounts of my premium for family, and one of them is missing and I want to remove that missing account from my plan.
@SpotifyCares It helped after a while. Working now 😊
@SpotifyCares WHAT IS THIS
@SpotifyCares Some have just gone all together. Last night the only albums/artist I could see is what I’ve recently played. Nothing was there in album/artist. This morning some have come back but nothing appears to be downloaded. Can you help?
@SpotifyCares Hi. I clicked on the fb ad to get premium for only 9php for 3 months, chose it to be billed on my Smart postpaid. When I got the confirmation for my subscription through SMS, I was actually charged 129php for 1 month.
@SpotifyCares I was just using it then it locked me out for no reason. I can't sign back in..
@SpotifyCares How come I can't change the country I moved to in my profile? I get told when I sign in it doesn't match up with current ISP code? I go to my profile and I can't change my country to match it up, what is up with that?
@SpotifyCares Ah thanks! It’s weird that I just got the error after way more than 14 days
@SpotifyCares I suspect it has to do with the fact that I have  new credit card but I can’t even access my account to input the new card info...extremely frustrating. @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares No, the ones I don’t ever listen to are still there for sure. It’s just the good ones that are gone. I’m sure it’s some algorithm thing but there should be a way to lock one so it updates but never goes away
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares thank you for answering! Makes sense. Happy Holidays!
@SpotifyCares Hey my accounts not working it’s saying that my passwords wrong I’ve tried to reset but the email ends up linking me to where I started and then tells me my CSRF token is invalid
@SpotifyCares Ok, hope it works soon!
@SpotifyCares Yes I would like to know how to sign up as an artist on Spotify
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/8dLVXrLcK0
@SpotifyCares No, it's included in my phone package so why would I pay for it twice? Will I have to delete my current acc and start again?
@SpotifyCares Okkkk thanks
@SpotifyCares What is the point? You’ve done nothing about it and people have been asking for years. I want to protect my children and you clearly have your own agenda as other streaming services manage to filter explicit content.
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares haha i like the song reference! will do :) y'all are amazing! the ready made playlists on the browse page gets me through the day
@SpotifyCares Tried clearing cache, normal, incognito, and from in the app. All still give that error.
@SpotifyCares Tried again and finally got it to take. The issue is now resolved.
@SpotifyCares But also can I have some of that #ad money?
@SpotifyCares Send a HTTP GET request (eg: https://t.co/Mm27ynlOyQ) using any device. Tested on Windows and Linux with CURL, ajax and Firebug.
@SpotifyCares ...that's just a link to the documentation. Try using your own API Console (beta) and you'll see the exact issue: https://t.co/mEvJYmzg7a
@SpotifyCares Desktop! i didnt think youd answer im so sorry i love you so much i didnt mean a single mean word
@SpotifyCares oh its working now!!! i guess it was just a momentary glitch. sorry for the trouble!! i love you so much my sweet baby child u r so sweet
@SpotifyCares Dear MT, I like, Pop, Rock (Only 2000s rock), Jazz, Classical, Musical soundtracks, Country, EDM, LATINO for sure Spanish songs and party music, I hope that helps you, I basically like everything but Rap, Well Rap is okay just not grime
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Android 7.0, Spotify version 8.4.28.875
@SpotifyCares A restart seems to have fixed the black screen issue. However it still switches to offline mode between sessions (on both wifi and data,).
@SpotifyCares This is what is popping up when I try to reset it https://t.co/c3YZ0QsdBz
@SpotifyCares the 503 errors happened this morning and then about 2 hours ago. They were transient errors lasting a few mins each time, which I think is what 503 errors mean anyway. They happened on my local machine and production servers and they were errors from the API, not the app.
@SpotifyCares I actually fixed it. Needed to delete my cookies before it would send another email.
@SpotifyCares Im using a Samsung galaxy s7
@SpotifyCares __email__
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8 Plus, Spotify version 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares That didn’t work. This was an issue too on my iPhone 6. Not a huge deal, just slightly frustrating. If you have any other ideas, let me know! Thx
@SpotifyCares Legit it's the only reason why I think people use pandora instead of Spotify. Waking up to your favorite song would be amazing. There's a lot of opportunity here if you do it correctly.
@SpotifyCares Millions of people wake up to alarm clocks on their phones everyday. So why not have them wake up to their favorite tune? Pandora, Apple Music have it so I think it's time we get on it too!
@SpotifyCares 💚 https://t.co/VPKy97oO0L
@SpotifyCares It just keep showing this ads and I need kill the app to remove it, the dismiss button is not working https://t.co/aBHnWvJpyA
@SpotifyCares What is Dm?
@SpotifyCares Not helpful. I found this twitter handle on the website. Whoever is getting in ie changing the password before we can. Changed email PW. Need more support or to stop paying for premium.
@SpotifyCares there's a queue for shuffling/choosing song but not when you SEARCH a song because it only plays what you searched which is great but (1/2) https://t.co/vMQDkcd3BJ
@SpotifyCares -no, not what i'm looking for...

how do i make this playlist read "created by blimes brixton" rather than "samela anderson" 
https://t.co/85hwiG7mgH
@SpotifyCares Not potoshopped. https://t.co/v96DUy0oTX
@SpotifyCares Aw ! That's fine... I've found an fix to my problem 😘 (I switched to @GooglePlayMusic )
@SpotifyCares 😂😂 you're so nice at Spotify... I may switch back on your app one day :/ you are so cool on Twitter 😘
@SpotifyCares when im listening to music it states that i can click the thing to get 30 minutes of ad free listening but when i go to click the part that has been there in the past, its not there so i cant do anything. it has done this about three times since i started listening today
@SpotifyCares nope, everything else about the app has worked fine except that it wont let me even try to watch a video to get this time
@SpotifyCares oh no it was there at 12 y'all did great &lt;3
@SpotifyCares thank you
@SpotifyCares I never thought you guys would reply but thankss😂💙💙
@SpotifyCares I'm using a PC, Windows 10, and I don't know where to find the version I'm running
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares well there's a bit of a catch 21 here, I spend quite a bit of time every week listening to discover weekly and release radar (new music is great), and those lists in turn keep reinforcing I listen to finnish music. :)
@SpotifyCares USA. It became available on my end around 10:15 pm Mountain Time. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I’m on an iPhone 6 and my Spotify is the most recent version.
@SpotifyCares Sure it’s 11.1.2
@SpotifyCares ... the problem you will be received with over 100 results of the people suffering this problem. This goes back to 2013 as said by users which wrote through the Spotify subreddits and communities. After all the updates, where the hell id the support?
@SpotifyCares ALSSOO when is the 2017 Most Played Songs playlists coming out?
@SpotifyCares Windows 10
Spotify 1.0.68.407
@SpotifyCares Okay. It was just weird not having anything about her album being available on the platform.
@SpotifyCares Thank you 🙌🏻🙌🏻
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!
@SpotifyCares It's disappeared and upload on this specific date to make the playlist. This is the third time this happened. https://t.co/8pIv10Goao
@SpotifyCares Suppose to be on New Music Friday https://t.co/8pIv10Goao
@SpotifyCares This is why I gladly give you guys my money each month thank you!😁
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much I'll be waiting for it mean while I listen to hefner by @226666
@SpotifyCares My premium account has become inactive sadly. It won't let me do anything. Go to a free account update or anything
@SpotifyCares __email__
Thank you :)
@SpotifyCares Superstars! 👌
@SpotifyCares Thanks, had already tried that to no avail.
@SpotifyCares I missed you guys! Keep it up
@SpotifyCares Windows7, chrome, it has been 2 days. Logout doesn't help. When I try to open the player, the whole browser lags.
@SpotifyCares 8.4.29.289 arm/7 is the spotify and im using a galaxy s6 fully updated only start happening yesterday been using it for a long time with no problems
@SpotifyCares Think that sorted it doesn't sound like iv a walkman in my pocket anymore , thanks for the help 👍
@SpotifyCares and yes, latest update/IOS
@SpotifyCares I voted...but that idea is from 2014. We’re 3 generations of Apple Watch in and you guys still haven’t come up with something? Your Dev team makes changes at a snails pace...they need to step on the gas or the competition will lap you many times over
@SpotifyCares I have a sound touch (Bose) but the spotify app won't connect, it just tells me to try again later
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8 plus, iOS, umm latest version of Spotify? Only started this morning.. didn’t have it yesterday thanks
@SpotifyCares Working now, thanks AY!
@SpotifyCares @147836 So you guys can confirm THATS ITS COMING BACK??? 😱😱 #SpotifyYearInMusic https://t.co/4bN938eq3q
@SpotifyCares @115888
@SpotifyCares Still does not work?! I don’t understand how can go from working to having to delete and then resumc and yet still no luck
@SpotifyCares Yes so they all saved on my mac and saved these playlists to phone
@SpotifyCares No luck- for all it works fine it’s just songs that aren’t from spotify- but this previously worked fine
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/69WxeWVJ19
@SpotifyCares Didn’t work actually....?
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/6RQHXB6Ksm
@SpotifyCares It’s when playing with my musiccast wx010 , using my iPhone 6s, most up to date iOS, and fully updated spotify
@SpotifyCares Thank you very much x
@SpotifyCares This is not a problem of my specific instance of the app. This is a problem of the Android app in general.
@SpotifyCares Really? It opens pretty easily for me. Try this one  https://t.co/B2ttM0mYQv  and look for Spotify Music. Your app has 4 trackers in it. It's not acceptable!
@SpotifyCares I’m currently located in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. I login via my Facebook account.
@SpotifyCares Hey PK everything seems to have gone quiet and still no sign of the track on Spotify!
@SpotifyCares @228595 Gutted, just missed my Vodafone free 2 Years premium by 1 day ahhhh
@SpotifyCares Looks like just 'High' and 'All of Your Love' but the rest of the music under that particular artist is a little skeptical too. Half of it seems to be rap and the other half is instrumental, not sure if that's right either. Thanks for replying!
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/wYdN8IAH9z and https://t.co/4xjFbJX5Ms
@SpotifyCares Thx spot
@SpotifyCares I have a premium subscription for students using Visa but in the next month subscription payment failed, that's why?
Thx
@SpotifyCares 🙌 thank you. I’m using windows 10 pro version 1607 and google chrome v62.0.3202.94. Restarting hasn’t helped. It just is stuck like this... (it says I’m listening already but I’m not 😩) https://t.co/5iP6N21j2N
@SpotifyCares Same thing 😩 cleared browsing history and cache in Chrome and didn’t work. Tried in Firefox and still shows the same stuck screen..
@SpotifyCares Thanks ☺️ nope I had my fingers crossed for incognito mode but it didn’t work through that either. I’m on my work WiFi but been using it all week with no issues. Then paused it on Wednesday and that’s where it’s been stuck since
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I decided to update to High Serra. Currently installing. I’ll try Spotify after that and give you a shout if it still misbehaves 😉
@SpotifyCares Everything is back to NORMAL!! My fault not updating.. whoops. Thankssssss 😬
@SpotifyCares Hi do you know if Spotify is releasing the playlist that compiles the songs you've listened to most throughout the year?
@SpotifyCares Check! Even though I have enough load for this. I alreayd tried to clear the Browser's cache and cookies. https://t.co/85u4gM5mu9
@SpotifyCares The album is called Distant Relatives by Nas &amp; Damian Marley. I'm in Australia
@SpotifyCares I meant the “music in year” actually. In 2015 and 2016 we got a playlist of our most streamed songs in that year. I cant find it now...
@SpotifyCares Thanks a lot!! Very exited! 😆
@SpotifyCares Web player is now working again for me, thanks for the response.
@SpotifyCares @230509 No it's back down again. That dll. is missing again after a reboot of my computer. It's a bad problem.
@SpotifyCares Yes they are up to date. I just have an issue when I'm listening to a playlist sometimes it will pause the song. And the only way to fix it is to start the song again
@SpotifyCares It's something that has been happening for over a month now. Thankfully my old laptop just about works but I wanted to get rid of that
@SpotifyCares I have my phone but it isn't ideal when listening to music at home. My fancy but ancient speakers don't work with it. Also I used to like if I had people round we could all add to the play queue. Phone isn't the same
@SpotifyCares @230513 English better, DM please
@SpotifyCares I actually figured it out already and am up to date. All is well. Thanks for the timely response though.
@SpotifyCares Thank you. Xx
@SpotifyCares You can solve this issue with a regex and one line of code, it's not that hard. What possible reason could there be for you to allow users to include full phone numbers in their accounts? What is the use case for that?
@SpotifyCares Here, saved you some work:

/^[(]{0,1}[0-9]{3}[)]{0,1}[-\s\.]{0,1}[0-9]{3}[-\s\.]{0,1}[0-9]{4}$/
@SpotifyCares Yeah man this thing freezes more than the north pool
@SpotifyCares Samsung Galaxy S8, Nougat OS, and version 8.4.28.875 armV7
@SpotifyCares @231388 Can other people get support too or (please reply to my dm Jesus)
@SpotifyCares thank you &lt;3 much appreciated!
@SpotifyCares One reason: "Your Spotify app needs updating." App updates require deleting all offline files? So I should just never update your app?
@SpotifyCares All fixed now cheers Smittens
@SpotifyCares @231900 This is so ridiculous ANSWER MY TWEETS
@SpotifyCares Same message from that page. If it helps, I have a British account, but am currently in Finland...
@SpotifyCares I’ll try english :-) I created a playlist on my account. Can I transfer it to another account? So it stays available if I ever delete mine? Thank you!
@SpotifyCares My username us kalie.filice the email is __email__
@SpotifyCares Seems to be working fine now after doing that, thanks!
@SpotifyCares There's already a thread about it, but I would like to know when it's going to be fixed...any idea?  https://t.co/pq05NPr36M
@SpotifyCares English is fine! I went from premium to premium family and I want to add my daughter. She got the invitationcode by mail. But hasn’t got a account yet. What to do?
@SpotifyCares Oké! So first she makes her account and then, with the invitationcode, she can add herself to my family premium account? Big thank you!!!
@SpotifyCares WhoopWhoop we did it!!! 😘
@SpotifyCares Windows 7. I'm not sure which spotify version since it won't let me open the app
@SpotifyCares It didn't help :(((((((
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7s plus, iOS 11.1.1, Spotify updated this morning to 8.4.28.1104. 
Experiencing both using Bluetooth in my Toyota Corolla and played directly on device.
@SpotifyCares Seemed to be okay for a longer duration but still skips ahead.
@SpotifyCares I listen to mostly podcasts but will test with music today. Does the same when not using Bluetooth and just playing through phone speakers.
@SpotifyCares Ahhh, so this doesn’t apply to family accounts. Okay, thanks anyway though. Sad there’s a promotion for regular subscribers but nothing for family accounts. ☹️
@SpotifyCares @115888 I need answers in an hour. You don't have a contact number so how the hell else can I reach customer service. I've been a customer for 5+ YEARS. I'M NOT PAYING FOR A SERVICE I CAN'T USE. WHAT'S THE DEAL?!?
@SpotifyCares @115888 @SpotifyCares I'M GETTING THIS ERROR MESSAGE: The CSRF token is invalid. Please try to resubmit the form.
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Huawei p9 with Android 7.0, this is the version of the app (I've just realised I had missed an update so i just updated it, but it keeps doing it) https://t.co/97SFjbnvyJ
@SpotifyCares No it did nothing 😥 I also tried uninstalling, wiping the cache of the phone and reinstalling but it still crashes
@SpotifyCares Done
@SpotifyCares I sent it to your other Twitter feed, resent it now to this one
@SpotifyCares It did fix it. However, when I have tried to get a password reset w my email I get this "The CSRF token is invalid." so i have to sign up w fb.
@SpotifyCares I just deleted Spotify and downloaded it again same problem. Updated Spotify and iOS 11.1.2
@SpotifyCares I figured it out....changed password and logged out everywhere....a phone number for customer service would have been great in this kind of situation!
@SpotifyCares It's a Samsung j5. Spotify says it's up to date and it tells me what song is being played on the TV
@SpotifyCares Hi,
Received an e-offer to pay for  a year...but it's not available...?
what i miss...?
@SpotifyCares @233793 Don’t consider it, please just do it! Imagine watching a movie with no end credits—that would never fly in the film industry. Unfortunately we don’t have the industry-wide structures for enforcement, so someone needs to be a leader. Why not have it be @115888?
@SpotifyCares Great to hear. You surely ended up not caring about the 800000 of us who have exceeded the #10kSpotifyEpicCollectionLimit though. https://t.co/5tum4q7NTw
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I’m asking what kind of feature is this?
@SpotifyCares No it doesn't. I have to re-download ALL the songs again and this has been happening for the past couple of weeks
@SpotifyCares But don’t you think a thumbs down function on curated playlists would help personalize the experience?
@SpotifyCares Can I get a link. I ain't seeing it on Spotify's website
@SpotifyCares @115888 Now I've been charged for Student twice. I'm not a student. Please contact me. Thanks! 🌊🌊🌊
@SpotifyCares thanks! i guess my confusion comes from the design &amp; language, makes it seem like i'm signing up anew since you're gathering my billing info again and the button is to "start premium", when i already have premium and you have my billing info. please relay to your content/ux team
@SpotifyCares looks like it worked! (though success message was "you're premium now!" and checking my account looks like i'm still monthly, but looking closer reveals my next bill date is december 2018.  just a little wonky like maybe the system wasn't designed for this. anyhow, thx 4 help!
@SpotifyCares Speedygurl 
__email__ 
I'll stay with Soundcloud. You owe me 4/5 months @ $14.99 per month. Return all monies into my account asap
@SpotifyCares Done that =)
@SpotifyCares That really does - thank you!
@SpotifyCares Sorry I wasn't being literal. Just saying it would be nice to see it mixed up a bit, feels like every week it's the same thing. I need something new.,
@SpotifyCares If it’s for new users you can’t just fire off those emails to existing customers.  I’ve reminded you about this before
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/d1bRMjtWJN
@SpotifyCares It’s the same story on Firefox, it’s fine on my phone and the app on my Mac works but I really need to use the web player unfortunately.
@SpotifyCares Will it be personalized like previous years or the same as last year??
@SpotifyCares Well if I’m shuffling the discover weekly - the French shit will be listened to and the cycle continues... shite!
@SpotifyCares mine is still broken it’s like my account is deleted or something please help
@SpotifyCares Or does the subscription not begin until January?
@SpotifyCares Thanks, well I've figured out it seems to be a firewall issue. Why does the web player work and not the app? Are there specific ports needed to be open?
@SpotifyCares I have.  Here's a whole bunch of people with the same issue, so I know it's not me.  Finally managed to reinstall old version. Will wait it out until it gets straightened out on your end.  Thanks. 
https://t.co/57Wdm4HcOn
@SpotifyCares Weird - on my laptop (macOS 10.12.6, spotify 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf) I get live versions of both tracks. On my iPad (iOS 11.1.2, spotify 8.4.28.1104) I get the album versions. If I switch device partway through it switches versions.
@SpotifyCares For whatever it's worth, my android phone and echo both get the album versions. It's just my laptop that has the live version. I guess it could be cached but how would I end up with it?
@SpotifyCares Figured it out! Realised I have mp3s of a gig on my laptop, and confirmed it's the same version that gets played. So the question now is: why does Spotify only use that other version of one song, and none of the other album tracks that are also on the live album?
@SpotifyCares Sigh. And if I move those mp3s away, spotify won't play the song at all: "This song is not available. If you have the file on your computer you can import it."
@SpotifyCares Please help!
@SpotifyCares That didn't work :/ I'm on a Samsung S7 SM-G930F, Android 7.0, Spotify Version 8.4.29.289 armV7. The filter to only show downloaded episodes works fine, and the problem is in both viewing a single podcasts' episodes and viewing all unplayed episodes in my library. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Just updated the app again to 8.4.30.688 (newest I can download from Play Store) and the problem persists
@SpotifyCares random order on artist page https://t.co/qvVfYUl9vv
@SpotifyCares Everything is so bad! Your system is completely down. I’m a premium customer and I have 4 days that streaming does not work.
@SpotifyCares Not really I actually think over all the app is shit. There’s not enough options. You can’t skip the songs you want without paying 9.99 a month which is disgusting.... frankly it’s not worth the space on my phone.... waste of time and money.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply! I had already cleared the cache &amp; cookies prior to my tweet. That didn't help. Just tried (on your request) incognito on Chrome (the usual browser I use for Spotify at work). Nada. Can't try on other browsers ATM, but will keep you all posted...
@SpotifyCares @115888 Yeah,  I know. It's my fault for having a shitty password. But like, who wants to hack my spotify account?  Apparently someone.  But now I can't get it back.
@SpotifyCares Works now :)
@SpotifyCares Bought the Beats Studio 3 today and I can't control Spotify with it as with the Beats Solo 3.
@SpotifyCares That of course helped nothing and is no solution for all other users...
@SpotifyCares Works with keyboard and Beats Solo 3 tho
@SpotifyCares Latest Spotify on latest High Sierra, Beats Studio 3
@SpotifyCares Hi sorry forgot to delete the message I actually found an email about it in my spam folder managed to get it thank you though! :)
@SpotifyCares I have sent a DM - thanks for looking into this. I look forward to your reply!
@SpotifyCares Thank you! It’s been doing mine and many other fans heads in!
@SpotifyCares This is why I love Spotify over Apple Music ❤️
@SpotifyCares I’m in a chat right now with customer service, so I guess that’s the next best thing... talking on the phone is way easier though... and a heck of a lot faster...
@SpotifyCares Thanks! We got the issue figured out! But got disconnected before I could say thanks... 😔
@SpotifyCares Thank you! 😍✨
@SpotifyCares Well I have not seen the purple banner popup again, I have since restarted my phone, would logging out/in actually make the banner come back? Not really that eager to give feedback
@SpotifyCares Yes, that answers my question, thank you. 😊
@SpotifyCares I also changed countries, but it still shows me the old country, but not everywhere
@SpotifyCares I also can’t add my wife (are you gonna tell me she doesn’t live here either?) because when I send an email to her Hotmail account she never receives it (it’s not in Spam).
@SpotifyCares #MusicFreeFriday

#DesperatelyMissingRdioAboutNow
@SpotifyCares So... every time I restart my computer.... it tries to install the faulty new version.  So I then need to uninstall... again... every last file...... and reinstall the old version.
Every.
Time. 

Surely, there's a patch to keep us up &amp; running while you get a handle on this, no?
@SpotifyCares I was asked earlier to sign in again as my '3 month trial period' was up and if I wanted to upgrade to premium...???..I subscribe and pay for premium via my mobile provider, so was wondering if there was a known issue..??
@SpotifyCares I'm using OS El Capitan 10.11.6 and my Spotify version is 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf
@SpotifyCares I cannot see anything! The screen turns black and the fans go off..ultimately the system shuts down!
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your response. I have double checked my spam/junk emails and I didn't anything regarding the application- only emails about artists that are in town.
@SpotifyCares I just applied again just in case I don't miss the deadline. When I did, I received the automatic response from Jobvite! So now just the waiting game. Thank you again for your help.-Jean
@SpotifyCares MacBook Pro 15-inch, mid 2012, macOS High Sierra (10.13.1), spotify version 1.0.68.407. But this has been the case for a while, on previous OS versions and with previous spotify versions
@SpotifyCares (One previous thread here https://t.co/hoQejA4HyW)
@SpotifyCares It doesn’t
@SpotifyCares This has helped a bit. Just fyi I don’t appear to have either of the folders it tells me delete in those instructions. Did a search as well as looking in the locations it tells me to and they didn’t appear
@SpotifyCares I no longer use the email that was once connected to my Facebook. I have since updated my email on FB and but I cannot seem to get that to change over on my Spotify account. I use a MacBook Pro.
@SpotifyCares I understand that but I wish there was a way to tell it to default to the explicit version when it's available.
@SpotifyCares Or at least make the different versions more clear. For example, it's hard to tell which of these is the explicit version and which is the censored version. https://t.co/1ycAQlILq9
@SpotifyCares Device is Android phone (Nexus 5x), happens on that and on Win10 laptop (tho, of course, I can't connect to Chromecast straight from the laptop; I have to connect to it via the phone first). Latest versions of Spotify, I believe.
@SpotifyCares I mean, yeah, it usually does. The problem is that I'm trying to listen to a continuous playlist or album uninterrupted. It fixes the error but doesn't solve the problem.
@SpotifyCares will reset the router when I get home. What do you mean by different connections?
@SpotifyCares Hm. not sure I have access to an alternate wifi network with speakers  that I can hook up the Chromecast to and run for 30-45 min, but I'll see...
@SpotifyCares Sonos Play:1
@SpotifyCares No
@SpotifyCares Nope. After a while it starts the issue again.
@SpotifyCares This has helped. So far. I shall get in contact again if it happens again.
@SpotifyCares MacBook Pro, MacOS Sierra, Spotify premium, 1.0.68.407
@SpotifyCares thanks a lot but i figured it out already! :)
@SpotifyCares Of course not, I just found I have got 2 accounts. I still love you ❤
@SpotifyCares Yes I currently have premium and pay £9.99 a month. But obviously this offer is essentially 2 months free for the year. So yes let me know if something is feasible
@SpotifyCares @237305 Is this going to be fixed soon?  I have an I phone 7 and it’s doing the same thing. I had to reduce my text size also so now my playlist isn’t overlapping but I can’t read my text messages.
@SpotifyCares And I have a brand new 8 plus
@SpotifyCares It is still not working. Can you see it? https://t.co/UYjoj43zK8
@SpotifyCares Maybe I will try to delete it again when I get home, reboot the phone and reinstall. Will let you know.
@SpotifyCares I tried all that before asking you and it hasn’t not helped.
@SpotifyCares Yeah I checked the website. I keep getting this error message.. https://t.co/m0RTwEujJg
@SpotifyCares Done that and it's still coming up with the same error message
@SpotifyCares My card won’t go through for me to re-subscribe but my bank said my cards work
@SpotifyCares No that didn’t help :/
@SpotifyCares Hmm relaunching fixed it thanks!
@SpotifyCares Sounds great, I really miss it. But it is months now, what is the odds that it will be back, really? Still, the idea of letting us know on whose demand and for what reason tunes are removed would be greatly appreciated. And transparent, which we all love. :)
@SpotifyCares Splendid! Thanks, it is appreciated.
@SpotifyCares Haha! Thanks! Well, if this feature could get in I would be happy for a while. ;) Oh, and party mode. Or let's call it collaborative mode perhaps to make it more hip and interesting. That would be nice.
@SpotifyCares Hi

Galaxy S8 G9505
Android 7.0
Spotify 8.4.29.289 has been updated since issue commenced.

Also if relevant Samsung experience 8.1

Streaming to JBL extreme but occurred when deciding to switch from other device to S8 in Spotify
@SpotifyCares No did not help. Reinstalled Spotify no change
@SpotifyCares That link worked! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares canada
@SpotifyCares hello hi.... may i ask why “yes lawd!” was once again removed from spotify 😭
@SpotifyCares Spotify Version 8.4.30.688 arm v7, samsung galaxy s6 with android-version 7
@SpotifyCares The problems started since I 've switched to spotify premium here in the netherlands. Before that, there were no problems
@SpotifyCares Well, it's not just one router to reset, it's on every wifi network...
@SpotifyCares Sure, thanks! I know my workplace (as we play different accounts on the main speakers) also has this issue.
@SpotifyCares :) thanks for the reply. I need this option daily, so sure others out there do to. Hope to see it soon haha. https://t.co/gidM1XaoyN
@SpotifyCares This is really bad news. I had been slowly being weaned off of my iTunes library due to the Local Files but now I will stay with iTunes
@SpotifyCares Those need to be distinct. How can I just turn off the Spotify algorithm? Spotify doesn’t have the songs so I have to use local files
@SpotifyCares Well, then the name of the song would be wrong.
@SpotifyCares yeah there is something i want help with, can i dm you
@SpotifyCares Artist: https://t.co/zRo6zSna4S

@SpotifyCares https://t.co/tx6dxazoeF
@SpotifyCares 🙏🏻 thanks!
@SpotifyCares What about India, Pakistan etc?
@SpotifyCares I already solved by myself, delete all Spotify files on my PC and re-install
@SpotifyCares begin again LOL and your support link is 404 https://t.co/KGl1eRevws https://t.co/3OSWF08yhT
@SpotifyCares @240749 Dear Spotify, There is no paypal on payment option. Please check. https://t.co/XB3espEw9S
@SpotifyCares I use atm, doku, and alfa it's doesnt work, it still 49.990. I havent get premium before
@SpotifyCares @240750 How to pay it? Just for credit card?
@SpotifyCares No. I do not believe that it did.
@SpotifyCares Yes. It was one of the involuntary ones that you have the option of cancelling, but I didn’t cancel it.
@SpotifyCares it keeps on telling me payment method failed?
@SpotifyCares also, how long will it take for a song to upload there?
@SpotifyCares omg thank you so much!
@SpotifyCares Thanks. None of those seem to apply. I don’t get an error about &gt;3333 downloads
@SpotifyCares Only 2/3.  A slot left.
@SpotifyCares Nevermind i fixed it
@SpotifyCares Please email me at __email__
@SpotifyCares thanks PK, but I figured it out. have a good day 😎
@SpotifyCares @243843 why it's not available worldwide ... @5085 is a global superstar lol #sad
@SpotifyCares Close, I'm talking about if I'm playing a song queue and am browsing for more songs and want to have the next song i queue to play first,  i.e. a 'play next' button.
He slow respond @SpotifyCares ........
@SpotifyCares Hello @SpotifyCares can you replied my problem?
@SpotifyCares The song YuNg BrAtZ is not on my playlist but when I look at “Next From” it’s there. Also, my playlist says 40 songs but I counted 39. I don’t know how to take the song off. https://t.co/Q49Ti5kVmL
@SpotifyCares Hi, Please I don't have a credit card and I'd like pay via my Google play Store. Please I want to find out it's acceptable. Looking forward to your response..thank you.
@SpotifyCares Still not working properly
@SpotifyCares It did not work.
@SpotifyCares IOS is 11.1.2. Spotify version 8.4.28.1104 https://t.co/8xVX0GCO2t
@SpotifyCares All of this is exactly what I do not want to happen
@SpotifyCares Tried that. The problem persists. I also tried deleting app and reinstalling the app. I am using the most recent version. 8.4.28.1104. Thank you for your help.
@SpotifyCares Figured it out. I turned on larger type because my eyes suck. Turned it off and fixed. Leave it to us old guys to screw things up. Didn’t see that coming.
@SpotifyCares Will do and thanks again.
@SpotifyCares This link worked. But FYI, the link I showed you is what came in my promo email.
@SpotifyCares That link worked - thank you!
@SpotifyCares He just messaged you again!
@SpotifyCares Edit : Nevermind somehow it just magically popped back up!
@SpotifyCares iphone 7, i don’t know operating system, and it’s the last version of spotify
@SpotifyCares version 11.1.2 (15B202)
the first time that I can remember happened last week, my phone was locked and the song that was playing I have downloaded
@SpotifyCares i have all my songs downloaded so it happens only with them
@SpotifyCares I recently reinstalled spotify, like 2 weeks ago, I have to do it again?
@SpotifyCares Hi. It's ok. I cleared my browser's cache in privacy settings and it fixed it. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I have been on your waiting list for a while now. 😭Dont make me annoy my cousin in US again to buy me a @115888 gift card in order to up my sub.
@SpotifyCares Got it 😊Thanks admin. It's so helpful
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/2WLaMZt0MG
@SpotifyCares Thanks. But it's not a playlist but an album. 10 songs maybe a ratio algorithm? 1 suggested song per 3 album songs. Rounded down. I would get 3 suggested songs and not an almost 1:1 ratio...seemed higher.
@SpotifyCares yeah.  All that happened is i went to use Spotify and there were no songs downloaded.  All I've used sd cards for literally was music storage.  This happens all the time.
@SpotifyCares Yesterday and about 2 months ago was the other pin
 Literally launched Spotify and no music was downloaded anymore both times
@SpotifyCares It cannot be formatted.
@SpotifyCares @147836 No answer?
@SpotifyCares pls put it back or i'll cry
@SpotifyCares When I search for "Dig That Crazy Christmas" instead, and click on the link to the album in the table of results, the client does correctly take me to the album. I hope this bug report is clear enough, feel free to reach out to me if you need more info!
@SpotifyCares Oh, I wasn't getting an error message, I was just reporting some odd behavior from within the client itself when clicking on an in-client link to the album. Naturally, viewing the album from the provided link works. :)
@SpotifyCares @115888 @248108 and BTW, you'll even benefit a lot if you'll put up GOT7's song on Spotify cause they have a bajillion of fans (called AHGASES) WORLDWIDE, so basically more ppl will tune in to Spotify cause of them. 💚
Just sayin' yknow 🤔😉 

@115888 @SpotifyCares 
#GOT7onSpotify
@SpotifyCares I have an LG Aristo... And use it to entertain my uber riders... Please don't let me done #Spotify
@SpotifyCares And no error messages just drops anything I open anything else... Even after deleting all my photos and unneeded apps
@SpotifyCares Is there anything i can help? 😭
@SpotifyCares Well that and how it's funtioning? Idk it plays everything as a radio except for when I listen to my daily mixes. And my device is a galaxy j3 emerge
@SpotifyCares API came back up after a few minutes, and we demoed with Astley Avenue! Thank you! https://t.co/XIs31ZJKpo
@SpotifyCares No difference... Still not working
@SpotifyCares Panic over. Removed &amp; reinstalled app. All sorted. 😅
@SpotifyCares @116130 SpotifyCares?! Clearly do not care. Poor service for a Premium customer. Other streaming services are available!!
@SpotifyCares Is this still the current company policy? Tbh I'll switch to another streaming service if it is. https://t.co/CmBfgqIh8q
@SpotifyCares Having searched your Community page, this has been an issue for multiple Premium users since at least 2012. Why your 'tech folks' can't add such a basic feature is beyond me!
@SpotifyCares Thank you 🙂
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares over a month later &amp; Im still having to “force quit” &amp; reopen anytime I need to navigate anything. cancelling tomorrow - thx for nothing🙃🙃🙃🙃
@SpotifyCares I restart the app, and my computer frequently.   Ill try logging in and out.  Thank you!
@SpotifyCares No error messages.  It just gets stuck doing the thinking/loading circle and either takes minutes to load, or flat out doesn't. :(
@SpotifyCares I've already been told you can't play what you want on the iOS app if you have a free membership. It sucks, makes it pointless. I deleted the app.
@SpotifyCares Using the iPhone SE, with OS 11.2 and I have that blessed premium service and have for about three or more years!
@SpotifyCares BUT WHY YOU DIDN'T SIGN WITH THESE ARTIST THEY ARE GREAT AND I'M SURE THAT THEY WANT SING WITH YOU.
Also, they have many fans.
@SpotifyCares It’s iOS, iPhone 6s. v8.4.28.1104. I’m sure it’s working as intended but just a comment about how the queue works :)
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I already reverted the Family settings as well, though the invitee now sees a completely different name. One which I cannot seem to update anywhere. So my question is where is this name (can provide it by DM) coming from?
@SpotifyCares Don't worry found the link...
@SpotifyCares Yep that's the one, thanks. For some reason your link took me to the website but no further mention of the other could be found
@SpotifyCares thanks for nothing but whatever. i'll just cancel my subscription if this option isn't added.
@SpotifyCares Going to switch to Apple Music if you don't get back to my within the day. 😤
@SpotifyCares No you didn't but it's fine because I figured it out on my own 🙄
@SpotifyCares Nope, quite a few people with one plus 3s are having this issue please fix it, not paying for premium if this persists, music is unlistenable
@SpotifyCares Online and offline is same, used WiFi and mobile data still no change
@SpotifyCares When I went to use Spotify it was if I had never used it before, I clicked on a recently played artist and it went straight to the artist's page, not my saved songs, I closed and reopened it, it then showed my saved songs but nothing was downloaded, I didn't check my playlists
@SpotifyCares Yes that's fine
@SpotifyCares It has happened again! I have read the thing you sent me and none of them apply. I have the most up to date version of Spotify, listen everyday etc. Please can you tell me why this is happening as I am not happy!
@SpotifyCares Awesome but trans siberian orchestra seems to be absent from the rock/metal playlists.
@SpotifyCares It's cool I found a way to fix it on Google
@SpotifyCares No my son's getting a new phone for Christmas and he want s to have my other account. Is their a way to link them if i get the Spotify for 3 ppl
@SpotifyCares I actually just did that and now it’s working, just needed to restart rather then shut down, thanks
@SpotifyCares I think it's okay. I misread the new payment date because it's in US format
@SpotifyCares No. I try with email and it says log in with Facebook. When I try with Facebook it says no Facebook account linked and I'm going round in a loop
@SpotifyCares @25702 thank you
@SpotifyCares oh, you're so nice)))) thank you) have a good day.
@SpotifyCares Here https://t.co/MBrUDQ9nDu

@SpotifyCares So i was offered the winter promo, .99$ for 3 months... Can i still do that or is it for new subscribers?
@SpotifyCares Booooo. Hahahahaha thanks for the reply
@SpotifyCares Arigato, Danke, Gracias, Grazie, Merci, Spasiba, Takk, Thanks, Toda
@SpotifyCares Thanks, it worked.
@SpotifyCares Note 5 phone and nexus 7 tablet. Now the song is gone from my tablets playlist as well. Guess the song just got taken off?
@SpotifyCares Nope the song is still gone
@SpotifyCares My company set up a new proxy that disables WebSockets. Both Spotify web and desktop clients seem to depend on them. There used to be a fallback available in Spotify web via the http=1 URL parameter, but it has been removed recently. I'm now asking if there is any alternative?
@SpotifyCares and i dont even have student anymore. its been 3 months since it switched over but i cant update card info unless i give student info that doesnt exist. https://t.co/VkBRpfthw5
@SpotifyCares i've tried to contact sheerID and spotify help and sent 3 e-mails but got no reply, P L E A S E take notice
@SpotifyCares Been 12 hours, still no answer. $10/month for the music, not customer service
@SpotifyCares It’s a family account...
@SpotifyCares Just for reference, I have tried both a Prepaid Visa AND a Mastercard, and yes I tried to cancel my Premium and re-join, but nothing works
@SpotifyCares Android version 7.0
Happens during either. I only tend to listen to songs or playlists that i've previously downloaded https://t.co/mxHvZA2654
@SpotifyCares I want to listen on my phone...slightly irrelevant question. Works fine on my pc but that's not the point, the issue is happening on my android phone...
@SpotifyCares macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 Public Beta (Build 17C79a). Spotify 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf.
@SpotifyCares No, but I also didn’t have this problem when I first updated to this beta version, either. It’s only just now started happening in the past few days.
@SpotifyCares Thanks 👍👍
@SpotifyCares Not @ PC tight now, but I'm getting the error msg every other W7 user is getting "Cannot find 'api-ms-win-core-processthreads-l1-1-2.dll'" since this file only exist in more recent windows versions. Your QA ppl should have detected this, it's a very obvious issue.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/ZLrT5waWaC
@SpotifyCares It happened to albums that were downloaded and undownloaded. For example, I had every Relient K album saved in my library, but not all of them were downloaded to my phone. When I opened Spotify all but one of their albums were not in my Library anymore
@SpotifyCares Well it looks like they’re all back, but the downloads are still removed.
This same thing happened with Israel &amp; New Breed, and 2x4
@SpotifyCares Good morning. I still have the same problem. Te invitation code cant works. https://t.co/ULWVu1eOel
@SpotifyCares __email__. and member of my family __email__
@SpotifyCares Please do!
@SpotifyCares USA USA
@SpotifyCares ‘i mean’ and ‘complete’ by btob
please bring them back, thank you
@SpotifyCares I have already tried all of the possible options there but none will help me resolve the problem without talking directly to someone for help.
@SpotifyCares Also the newest version of Spotify
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 Plus on iOS 11.2
@SpotifyCares This video shows it https://t.co/7qjdKJJeGH
@SpotifyCares There appears to be no way to access your playlists, or simply stream what you're currently playing on your computer or Android app. It has nothing like the functionally of the Android app or competing Roku apps.
@SpotifyCares Latest version of Spotify. When the updates come in, that message pops up. I'm using Windows 7.
@SpotifyCares Turned off my antivirus, reinstalled, and still this. Whenever I close the program to let the latest update take hold, this happens. https://t.co/KP7uiXBBOw
@SpotifyCares That's a pity, I only listen to Spotify on my laptop at home with good speakers. During the day I'm working as a taxi-driver, can't sing along with the songs than, don't think the passengers would enjoy it. Especially when I'm the only one hearing the music through my earphones.
@SpotifyCares Xiaomi redmi note 3. I'm running Android 6.0.1 and I'm using Spotify 8.4.30.688.
@SpotifyCares It's not just one playlist./My account is set to Greece
@SpotifyCares I've tried opening it in an incognito window and the same thing happens.
@SpotifyCares Just an issue with my payments ! Nothing urgent !
@SpotifyCares I remember I think 2015's had all this really cool info about what you listened to throughout the year, it'd be awesome if something similar happened! 😃
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares It did work thanks
@SpotifyCares It's the wildly flashing background of the login you see in the video that bothers me.
Both my phones (LG G4, OnePlus 3) (Android 5 and 8) do that. Spotify v8.4.30.688.
@SpotifyCares It's 8.4.30.688 armV7. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Same version, different Android phone (Moto G5), same problem.
@SpotifyCares Great, thank you. I’m on an iPhone with iOS 11, but I think this has been a problem across multiple devices and operating systems since I’ve started using Spotify.
@SpotifyCares Thanks, but that’s not exactly a solution. There’s still no way to sort downloads/offline music.
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks, will do. Does that apply to the family/multi user tariff ?
@SpotifyCares amen to that
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7plus, iOS 11.2, Spotify version 8.4.28
@SpotifyCares @115888 could you help too?
@SpotifyCares It got fixed after an update! All good now
@SpotifyCares That link worked even without incognito. Thanks you very much!
@SpotifyCares So, when do you think this will happen? Would really like to run to Spotify on my Apple Watch @115858 @115888
@SpotifyCares yes, that works. I found the old page works for Mac, but not my iPhone. Looks like a mobile frontend issue…
@SpotifyCares Just chatted with customer service and figured it out. Thanks!! ;-)
@SpotifyCares I just want to listen to musc mane
@SpotifyCares It's my work computer, and I'm at home now, but I think it's Windows 10. I tried deleting all the Spotify files and all that, but it still gave me an error message.
@SpotifyCares It won't even let me DOWNLOAD it now.
@SpotifyCares I don't have a home computer--just a laptop. And it is running fine on here. It takes up TONS of space, though, and reinstalls newer versions seemingly several times a week when I open it, which is annoying.
@SpotifyCares Yes. It takes up tons of space with all the new versions, but it opens fine on my laptop. It's on my work computer that it's not working. I have to use the web browser version which isn't that great. When I left, my work computer was back to this error:

https://t.co/oOFnno89J7
@SpotifyCares I will try.
@SpotifyCares It's up and running now--thanks for the help! It might be useful to make it easier to find that, as from the Google searches I did make it seem like I'm one of many who have had issues with it.

But again, thanks for helping me fix it!
@SpotifyCares thank you for the response
@SpotifyCares is it possible to avail Spotify premium 9 pesos if you're using an existing account?
@SpotifyCares How long does it take to get these things updated?
@SpotifyCares I’m from the United Kingdom 🇬🇧
@SpotifyCares HTC 10 unlocked, android 7. I think it was happening when it was transitioning from bad wifi to cell data being off but can't recall when I pressed play. Why can't I load local data then update later? I was walking away from my home at the time.
@SpotifyCares Thank you. I greatly appreciate it. I reached out to them.
@SpotifyCares Spotify again bombed out today, same issue :( This time just on the ground. Now deleting all the app's data, directories and cache. Why doesn't Spotify support SmartLock ? I don't like typing password while driving
@SpotifyCares ill try thanks
@SpotifyCares I’m having trouble on my Win 7 computer after the new update. Says it’s missing ‘api-ms-win-core-processthreads-|1-1-1.dll’
@SpotifyCares When I go to Programs and click “Uninstall,” it shows me the same message as when I try to open Spotify. That it’s missing ‘api-ms-win-core-processthreads-|1-1-1.dll’
@SpotifyCares @147836 Finally able to send email address
@SpotifyCares I respondef
@SpotifyCares Android 8 Spotify app version 8.4.30.688 armV7
@SpotifyCares Figured it out! If you sign in with your email as the username it opens your account but not premium, only a free account. Is this a Glitch?
@SpotifyCares I know . You’ve said that for months
@SpotifyCares 👍👍👍
@SpotifyCares its showing error when i am submitting my request
@SpotifyCares I contacted to my distributor and they said that they didnt recieved the sales report of october for my song  Your Beautiful Face
@SpotifyCares Why is it in countries like Guatemala and not Croatia?
@SpotifyCares Still the same issue, sorry! It's not just that album either – it's literally every single album in the entire Spotify catalogue, they all show one year earlier. I even went as far as deleting all cache/preference files when reinstalling and still nothing.
@SpotifyCares Windows 7
@SpotifyCares Hey, there problem is still there. It stars up on boot-up automatically.
@SpotifyCares I guess this fixed my problem.
@SpotifyCares I have reinstalled but will keep you updated when I reboot my device. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares You guys need to update your windows 10 installing page according to creators update. It's not under system settings, it's under apps. https://t.co/dJSv7o3AuF
@SpotifyCares 1.0.66.478.g1296534d (Windows Store version)
@SpotifyCares i’m using an iphone 8
@SpotifyCares no, the song won’t play or it will stop exactly at 11 seconds within the song
@SpotifyCares i’ve tried deleting the app and downloading again and nothing is working. this is very annoying &amp; has been happening a lot lately.
@SpotifyCares It actually resolved itself! I think the App needed updated, Galaxy s8+, you guys are the best for replying though! 👌👍 #Spotifyforlife
@SpotifyCares I genuinely did not expect a reply to this, so thanks for taking the time to respond! Hopefully we'll get to the bottom of this together.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the help but resetting my iPhone worked! Keep doing you, Spotify 💕
@SpotifyCares I am also concerned about my personal details on my account and losing all of my many playlists (I pay for Premium and Spotify is the only site I use for my music).
@SpotifyCares Yeah still no change I would say there's a good number of songs that oddly aren't being featured and artists that aren't being played even though I've listened to many of their songs/albums @146177 @22806 @26470 Kanye West etc.
@SpotifyCares Yeah, RTJ And Em are always in heavy rotation for a long time and nothing yet.
@SpotifyCares i've already done this and it fixes it but if i restart my pc it starts giving me the error message again, so i have to delete spotify and reinstall it everytime i i turn my pc off, which is annoying.
@SpotifyCares ????? how is this any different from what you just told me??? I've already tried deleting spotify from the "roaming" and "local" folders and then reinstalling spotify. It fixes it, but as soon as i turn my pc off and on again it starts giving me the same error message again.
@SpotifyCares I just wanna know if spotify will ever be compatible with windows 7 again or if i have to upgrade to windows 10 to continue using it without problems.
@SpotifyCares Your customer fixed it. Thx
@SpotifyCares here we are 3 weeks later! what's the word? when do we get Alexa/Echo multiroom? Or if not, why not? Legal issues? @118117 getting upset with you? You just asked me to reup for a year for $100 and @115821 is making it real easy to quit you and move on - tell me why I shouldn't?
@SpotifyCares Thanks! It’s the not knowing if it’s going to happen that’s terribly annoying. It’s either a goal or it isn’t. I’m happy to wait some reasonable time if it’s coming, but if it isn’t, don’t keep me on tenterhooks. Let me move on to a supported service.
@SpotifyCares please check for me and get it back https://t.co/yHTSS641rH
@SpotifyCares and i think this other email acc, that received a premium pass (cause i paid for it) its actually using my acc 😥 and i cant use it cause this person changed the password
@SpotifyCares can i transfer it? help me. how can i do that?
@SpotifyCares will i receive my money back if i cancel it? its been not even one day. cmom i barely used it
@SpotifyCares so i guess i just wrote my email wrong and i cant log in anymore neither recovering my acc. my email is __email__ not __email__ i got my premium yesterday pls help me
@SpotifyCares Sure will! Can I benificiate of the promo if olI have a monthly renewal already?
@SpotifyCares @137949 Still no fix?
@SpotifyCares @137949 Works from desk top pc but not from phone
@SpotifyCares Still no answer 12 hours later?
@SpotifyCares My phone is a Nexus 6P running Android 7.1.2
@SpotifyCares Not helpful. ☹️
@SpotifyCares @263427 How else are your premium members supposed to feel if we cannot use the service at all on our device of choice when at the gym, etc?
@SpotifyCares @263427 Useful? I think you mean essential? I only  listen to music via Watch now, which means I can only just listen to @115948 , so why do I still need your Premium service, if I can't use it? Why you've failed to see this is a bit of an oversight.
@SpotifyCares I’ve sent you a dm yesterday evening (9hours ago), but no reply and I’m still without premium...
@SpotifyCares @116130 wow wtf where’s my account gone, paying money to listen to an ad 😪
@SpotifyCares Ok so this playlist is already set...but I want to put "tick tick boom" under "the way you used to do" but I can't cause the playlist is already set....is there a option to move just 1 or 2 songs around? https://t.co/4TqfJMRR30
@SpotifyCares Alright cool happy to know it's at least available but when will you guys add this option and put are own playlist cover on mobile?

@SpotifyCares My premium account, suddenly turn in to a free account, I have paid but I just can't go back to premium! I think it is cause of my address
@SpotifyCares We used the Contact Us section on the website to get this resolved. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Also Babyface didn’t sing this one either https://t.co/dPk0IyqvM7
@SpotifyCares Except you don't have an option for our own country on there...
@SpotifyCares All sorted now thanks! Managed to speak to someone on your chat. 👍
@SpotifyCares I have not but I’m about to! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Ahhh thank u💖
@SpotifyCares I've tried everything - different devices, networks, restarting everything, incognito. 

I've given up and I'll go for Prime Unlimited
@SpotifyCares I've used Chrome and IE on two different devices both on incognito and off.
@SpotifyCares Did you read my tweet? I'm trying to sign up... I don't have an account.
@SpotifyCares @264942 No, we can't anymore store music on SD card lel
@SpotifyCares In fact, I did things by myself and it worked. I had to repair my entire phone but the result is what I wanted. Thanks for your answer
@SpotifyCares Awesome! Ive been trying to figure out how to do that for years. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 running iOS 11. Spotify 8.4.20
@SpotifyCares I want to know why the pause button is so ugly in the notification center ha ha
@SpotifyCares Honor 8 Pro (or Honor V9 in China), Android 7.0, Spotify 8.4.28.875 armV7
@SpotifyCares I'll try in 30min :)
@SpotifyCares No need. I updated my payment info the hard way. Just update that page on the app’s interface to be more user friendly and we’ll be good
@SpotifyCares If you look at the band 'Rarity', there's songs in their popular section off a My Little Pony album.
@SpotifyCares A year later, still no dice, before I was able to cast from my phone but I'm at university now and their wifi networks are weird.
@SpotifyCares It's been happening ever since I bought my PS4 and downloaded Spotify a year ago, whenever I open Spotify, it shows this https://t.co/snUHarDUQr
@SpotifyCares Slide into my DMs?
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/N5JkIhvbRQ
@SpotifyCares Android 6.0.1
@SpotifyCares My issue is that i have over 130 songs on this playlist and when i shuffle, only the same 3 albums play, like it doesn't shuffle all
@SpotifyCares look. And I don't know, where do I check that? https://t.co/svAV2RtQm3
Can only do this on PC. Not on mobile unfortunately 

Hey @SpotifyCares please add this to mobile! I love this feature
@SpotifyCares Thanks.  

Using a Mac notebook.  IOs Sierra 10.12.6 and Not sure where to find the Spotify version but did find this 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares It did not. But shall try again

Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Thanks Spotify :/
@SpotifyCares Lol .. it wasn’t a complaint (I know not very social media) .. just mildly amused me. In fact, found something I liked. 😊
@SpotifyCares Oh.. I'm sorry I just thought that you understand filipino. Anyways, just want to ask how can I avail your P9.00 promo without a credit card?
@SpotifyCares You write Rp 4.990 in twitter, yet it is actually priced Rp 49.990 in the site.
@SpotifyCares I fixed it by uninstalling and reinstalling just now lol
@SpotifyCares I’m playing it from an iPhone 7. I have premium. I just did the update today
@SpotifyCares Pull up @266565 4eva is a mighty long time album for example
@SpotifyCares Ahh, okay cool. Not a big deal, would just make it clearer. Thanks for the help.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the prompt response &amp; looking into it so quickly ☺
@SpotifyCares My card had expired. MAYBE it should just actually say that, rather than a nonsense error which means i don’t know what the issue is?
@SpotifyCares This is the version of Spotify I’m on https://t.co/trV7xEuL6D
@SpotifyCares And this is the version of iOS I’m on https://t.co/ZOM0FfgFpT
@SpotifyCares  why i’m not receiving answers? I even DM you. Thanks in advance
@SpotifyCares Can you follow me?
@SpotifyCares I have one last question pls check dm thank you  :)))
@SpotifyCares I ask something pls notice me on dm
@SpotifyCares Done. Please check dm
@SpotifyCares Ah excellent, or even a favourite button or a gallery or something, been a few times where I have saved an album despite not liking it just for the artwork.
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares Bakit 129 pesos parin ang charge sa premium ?
@SpotifyCares @267081 hi, i sent you a dm, pls check.
@SpotifyCares @267084 SAME

@SpotifyCares Never mind. Fixed it!
@SpotifyCares thanks! 👍🏻

@SpotifyCares Said songs /albums are all free and easily available on every famous streaming service like Saavn, YouTube etc. Also on some mp3 songs websites
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much. I love your service as well as your quick response.
Hope i'll listen said songs very soon.
@SpotifyCares Why tho it was so much easier
@SpotifyCares No that didn’t help.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s Plus, iOS 11.1.2, Spotify 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares It’s not just my phone, my husbands 6s plus is the same way.
@SpotifyCares Actually I had to leave off “Larger text”. That’s the cause of the text in Spotify to overlap.
@SpotifyCares Restarting hasn't helped. Started on Monday.
@SpotifyCares Fine on my iOS and Amazon devices. Freeze/crash only occurs on my Windows 10 PC. I've had to completely uninstall the app for now because new installation appears to default to "Open on startup" which also freezes my system. Good luck!
@SpotifyCares App freezes and crashes on open before I can even check version number. Downloaded from the Win10 Store, latest release 10/24.
@SpotifyCares why i can purchase it using mobile topup
@SpotifyCares It worked after trying again.  Glad I can take advantage of this deal and make some Xmas playlists!  Thanks for the quick turnaround!
@SpotifyCares hey /RS 😂✌️🤪
@SpotifyCares Maybe I’m just a dumb grandma but I can’t play from playlists or recent, just from a search. Roku Express
@SpotifyCares Ok thks guys!!!
@SpotifyCares This isn't working 😢😢
@SpotifyCares __email__
@SpotifyCares Thank you this is all sorted now, thank you so much for your help!
@SpotifyCares I ONLY download to my phone. What happened here? Is my account hacked? How I can manage my devices to check if someone else is downloading?
@SpotifyCares Soo... still two?
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/pM3i0iZvif
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/qo3Lhqw2Br https://t.co/pM3i0iZvif
@SpotifyCares That link doesn't work in my country. LOL!
@SpotifyCares PS: still not working. LOL.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/jXoYV4d7I3. Not psyched about not having a straight answer from you, your suggestions not working and me ending up troubleshooting for you... :)
@SpotifyCares I’ve actually been a user since I did initially use the deal from last year, so I wouldn’t qualify :( I have loved my experience and told my brother about the deal, at least!
@SpotifyCares No, I've been a member for well over a year. If it doesn't know what I like by now, then it's not going to learn, is it.

It was perfect in the beginning and over the year it has turned to garbage. It prioritises the genres I maybe listen to 10% of the time. Reset please!
@SpotifyCares You know as well as I do that this has been a complaint by users for year AL :) I'm not blaming you, but I'm not paying anymore for a service that actively refuses to listen to users on this subject.
@SpotifyCares Yeah https://t.co/J7bkh2WnCL
@SpotifyCares Are you really relying on your customers to determine release dates? 😲 https://t.co/hVfI33IkZk The One-T ODC = 2003, The One-T's ABC = 2006
@SpotifyCares I hope that this time it will take less than 8 months! 😉 https://t.co/zwzobGJvME
@SpotifyCares Yes, my paypal account meets those requirements. Still no cigar.
@SpotifyCares It sends me here https://t.co/q1mkaiOuQY
@SpotifyCares Come soon to India... :)
@SpotifyCares I was thank you!
@SpotifyCares @138958 Me too. Just sent a DM.
@SpotifyCares For some reason that worked, thank you.
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Lenovo android 4.4.2 device on a wi-fi network.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s, latests ios and no particular songs. https://t.co/iab55T6TKe
@SpotifyCares I am using a samsung s8 but on my chromebook I also can not listen to this music and I am using the latest version of the spotify app some numbers I can not play: 16 million frenna and la legge del piu porte from chris nolan and trapano from madman
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares Hello! I have a spotify premium trial period which I would like to change to a student subscription, but how do I need to arrange that? Otherwise I end up paying 10€ instead of 5€. Trial period ends in 3 days
@SpotifyCares @269797 I agree with Daisy!
@SpotifyCares Cool, any chance of some more @108644 songs being available in the UK?
@SpotifyCares That’s a bummer. All your other Sonos integration is great. Hope it doesn’t force people to switch services.
@SpotifyCares aye
@SpotifyCares Sure thing. Basically the ad just never plays and music won't play as a result. Happens across browsers and devices too. https://t.co/Gnf7tMUnU3
@SpotifyCares Yup, happens in all browsers and other devices.
@SpotifyCares Fixed the issue by loading the Spotify app and trying to play a song there, cleared the issue across the account.
@SpotifyCares Tried all of that. Still stuck on the Blue Moon ad.
@SpotifyCares Someone got back to me via email, all sorted now. Thanks anyway!
@SpotifyCares Where would I contact them at?
it keeps getting better @SpotifyCares https://t.co/GppnpCl8TV
@SpotifyCares Third time's a charm? STILL NOT FIXED. How about push instead of a nudge this time?
@SpotifyCares Still not fixed... do you guys even have a content team? Or is it just one guy in a room without internet?
@SpotifyCares Still not fixed!
@SpotifyCares Its the only version on spotify. The first 3 minutes is the song in the title. After that a very long pause and more songs.
@SpotifyCares got sorted thanks
@SpotifyCares Cool we'll promise not to...
https://t.co/Tt4xyDzGMG
@SpotifyCares Cheers, will do
@SpotifyCares you guys are always winning 🤘🏼
@SpotifyCares 8.4.21.508 armV7
@SpotifyCares Both. Initially was on WiFi. But it's happened on the Gs too.
@SpotifyCares Great, thank you. Have a nice night.
@SpotifyCares Thanks but doesn't really answer my question??... is it coming back when you do "improve the service?"
@SpotifyCares Has this happened this week as it was fine prior to this
@SpotifyCares Avrx2000 Denon amp . Using Spotify app on Samsung s 6 .via wireless set up .says connected on the amp but isn't connecting via the phone and app.
@SpotifyCares Are you saying you can’t say why you’re not offering the deal in Quebec?

If it’s a regulatory issue tell us - I’ll bother my MNA about it.
@SpotifyCares You could offer the deal in Quebec. 

Why isn’t it offered here anyway?
@SpotifyCares just sent one! pls help
@SpotifyCares I have a 13", mid-2012 Macbook pro. if you need processor/RAM specs I can also provide that.
@SpotifyCares How in the bloody hell does some random Karaoke track get more popular than Queen?  Thanks for looking into it.
@SpotifyCares Hej! IMHO it would make sense to change the family accounts to be more Netflix-like: Limit the number of devices that can stream in parallel and have unlimited profiles on one account. Thus every Echo in house could use the same account.
@SpotifyCares @271208 OMG! 👏🏼😂😂
@SpotifyCares Lame
@SpotifyCares Okay Spotify
@SpotifyCares @271218 ????
@SpotifyCares @271218 @SpotifyCares HOW ABOUT YOU REPLY TO NET NOBODY.
@SpotifyCares Thank you but I already got it fixed☺
@SpotifyCares BLESS YOU
@SpotifyCares Thank you.
@SpotifyCares @29300
@SpotifyCares Everytime i contact support they screw this up and youre losing a customer for life at this point. I want my Facebook info gone. Completely fucking gone. I never ever ever want to receive a welcome back to Facebook email ever again after signing in to Spotify.
@SpotifyCares Appreciate it (as I’m listening to Spotify on my Echo Dot in one room).    Can’t wait to be able to play all throughout the house!
@SpotifyCares @185505 Spotify - you guys really need to give an answer to this.   Huge fan - but multiroom alexa changed everything.   Need functionality ASAP.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/Et4eyepxOz
@SpotifyCares oh hey, not about not liking, but in a metal band the recommendations were all pop music, thanks for checking this tho
@SpotifyCares So my wife and I can both use it on our separate phones plus my I pad then ?
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/MFCzMnYRjB

https://t.co/KHOdu9ftzt
@SpotifyCares USA
@SpotifyCares When will it be available?! I need some new Swifty in my lifeeeee
@SpotifyCares Please help. I don't want to have to cancel my account. I just want to pay $10 monthly for regular Spotify Premium. I think this glitch is happening because I originally signed up as a student but then upgraded to regular.
@SpotifyCares Android S6. My app is already updated but it still happens. I havent paid for the monthly subscription .it happens to my playlists I've made
@SpotifyCares Didn't help
@SpotifyCares Tribute 5, Android 5.1.1, latest update of the app.
@SpotifyCares The only time it didn't do this was when I had premium 😒
@SpotifyCares I only ever use Spotify on my phone
@SpotifyCares Tested without Gramofon, works as expected. Tested again with Gramofon, works as expected.

#NoFaultFound #StupidComputer #MostLikelyUserError
@SpotifyCares Yes everything works perfectly now. Thanks
@SpotifyCares I sent several emails to Spotify support on my problem- no response???
@SpotifyCares @273122 Why tho? Please help. https://t.co/yGA180cQmd
@SpotifyCares Well we (the kids in fact) were looking for the New album from K3. Love Cruise. Will this come to spotify? It was released last friday. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Also realized it isn't even playing the 2 most recent albums, only the top 10 songs. And it is putting some of them 4x in a row.
@SpotifyCares Each time I click on "Pay with paypal" it get me back to the offer page :/
@SpotifyCares @274157 same here!
@SpotifyCares @267235 Hi, sorry for drop in, but have same question. Because in the payment page, we can choose xl axiata as the provider. Although when i tried it, it says that it's error. Is it a mistake or it's planned for the future?
@SpotifyCares This one seems to be misnamed - https://t.co/xMLG8qp1ks It is called "13. janvāris" (album's track listing in Latvian wiki https://t.co/cYCaeijtX5 )
@SpotifyCares That doc doesn't include an Edit section for android, because it isn't possible on android, and that's ridiculous.
@SpotifyCares @115888
@SpotifyCares Only update to the latest Spotify version. Not the latest iOS. I'll click on the app, it will load the opening screen with the logo and immediately shut down. Unable to screenshot
@SpotifyCares I've deleted and reinstalled for a second time and it seems to be working now! There may be an issue for users with the previous iOS but the new app update... thanks for the help anyway 😸
@SpotifyCares Wow... Thanks for nothing
@SpotifyCares Well please wrap it up already. I'm not sure why you'd remove important features from an already functional app, rendering it  100% useless
@SpotifyCares Nexus 5X running Android 8.0.0 spotify version 8.4.21.508, I'm beginning to wonder if it's the OS that's killing it off due to lack of ram?
@SpotifyCares Just happened again, I logged out and back in to see if it helps, I have 13.28GB Free
@SpotifyCares This is happening on desktop. And on mobile it seems to be picking the same few artists again and again. Every time I press shuffle it's the same few artists.
@SpotifyCares It looks like I have to format the SD card as removable storage to get Spotify to use it, but that means I can't move apps to it?
@SpotifyCares Yes. There's no option to specify download location if I format the SD card to be used as extra internal storage (which is what it should be), only if I format it as removable storage.
@SpotifyCares You mean this is intended behaviour? That's... not great. So I can either be able to move apps to SD or download music to SD but not both. Wasn't the case in the past.
@SpotifyCares Not the first four times, seems back to normal after the fifth.
@SpotifyCares @139985 Well, here is a response.
@SpotifyCares I started with Wi-Fi, but I just checked on my phone using 4G and it has the same problem.
@SpotifyCares I see… How many votes does it take until a feature gets implemented?
.@SpotifyCares Tell them there should be keyboard shortcuts for everything! 😊 It's not hard to implement. Ever thought about #accessibility? https://t.co/KUg1uwQKkq
@SpotifyCares 👍
@SpotifyCares Huh. It's nearly 2pm Friday here in UK and they're still not on?
@SpotifyCares Still waiting 😂 you guys are gonna be a whole day behind in UK at this rate. What gives
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!
@SpotifyCares Having the same trouble on portable mac with latest OS and desktop PC with windows 10 latest version. Spotify version: 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3. No filters.
@SpotifyCares Playing tracks in my playlist.
@SpotifyCares Did not use connect yesterday, but it happends from time to time.
https://t.co/0YCE7G7KnA
@SpotifyCares Sometimes it does, sometimes it stops when I’m actively using it.
@SpotifyCares @275294 More deals? Like there have been deals for existing customers before?... because I’m a paying customer and I’ve never had a deal from you
@SpotifyCares I meant Spotify already works on VPN in non Spotify countries. We're already using it to listen to music but can't pay for premium yet.
@SpotifyCares it does this https://t.co/DL95oyGXTM
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much for resolving this issue! Much better, great work @115888 !
@SpotifyCares Thank you 😊
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/nSJcTCnDx7
@SpotifyCares I finally figured it out lol! Sorry!
@SpotifyCares @275709 Nothing is ever done for existing customers. I’m moving to Apple Music!
@SpotifyCares @275709 What a rubbish response. 😂
@SpotifyCares It happened with other songs too, but not all.
@SpotifyCares Like in this song, I keep hearing it at random times. I only have spotify opened and seriously no notifications at all. https://t.co/7LPrXqaOgU
@SpotifyCares Will try that, thank you :)
@SpotifyCares Hi, I'm trying to connect my Sony Xperia Xz1 to my Ps4. It was working fine until today. And my home WiFi network.
@SpotifyCares My ps4 just isn't showing up as a device on my phone when it's had no problem with this before.
@SpotifyCares Nope there has been no update. I turned my PlayStation on when I tried to play Spotify I was logged out. Already done that 😥
@SpotifyCares Andriod 8.0.0 and the version of Spotify is in the picture https://t.co/uARnZTOdIy
@SpotifyCares IP7 plus, IOS 11, Latest Spotify version
@SpotifyCares Worked 🤙🏾 Thanks!
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares if you actuallt care respond to netnobody
@SpotifyCares Sure. It's just a sigh, that current users still have to pay full price...
@SpotifyCares thanks a ton, found some good stuff :)
@SpotifyCares yes this song made my ears bleed and I do not want the artist to get the money for my listen
@SpotifyCares Messaged you
@SpotifyCares Cool beans! 👍
@SpotifyCares P.s. that is specifically in the "daily mix" when I shut down the client and then that same song pops up later in the playlist. Let me know if you need more details.
@SpotifyCares ok sounds good. Yeh the drag and drop could use a bit of love. All good for now, thanks
@SpotifyCares sounds good. While I have you, PLEASE bring back the personalized year in review this year. First play, most played, last play, most played album, song, artist, "top 100 played" playlist, mins listened, recommendations etc. Like the 2015 one.
@SpotifyCares Or maybe it was the 2014 one. Or even 2013. But not the 2016 one. That was such a disappointment. With all that listening data you have on me, I'd love to see it SUPER personalized. Thanks guys!
@SpotifyCares Okay! Thank You
@SpotifyCares Or when I’m playing it out loud through my phone speaker
@SpotifyCares WiFi, LTE, 3G/ 4G. The whole 9 yards!
@SpotifyCares Spotify: version 8.4.28
iPhone: version 11.1.2
@SpotifyCares All good Spotify. I think my vintage iPhone 6 was wigging out! Working now!
@SpotifyCares Submitted! Thank's for letting me know Jo!
@SpotifyCares what is /MU?
@SpotifyCares Sent.
@SpotifyCares still a student... even if i log into uni days, i've still been charged £10 for the month when i am eligible for the £4.99 offer
@SpotifyCares I made a comment, but since this thread is going for so long, I'm not left with a convincing feeling that Spotify is watching this feedback.
@SpotifyCares Well, it is fixed now. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Can you make it available? @209394
@SpotifyCares I love you 😂 yeah we can
@SpotifyCares Thanks a lot, i listen to that playlist a lot and i love that song. It'd be awesome if you can add it!! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares this has been happening for months but there is nothing wrong with my visa debit https://t.co/puiSjFK7de
@SpotifyCares You can help me by giving me my box of KitKat's. 😆
@SpotifyCares Ok, but I see you haven't mentioned anything about my portion of the profits... don't change the subject!! How about I get 1/3 and a box of KitKat's?
@SpotifyCares It only happens like every  few days so there is now way to tell but I'll do that and reply to this tread if it happens again
@SpotifyCares Galaxy S6 running Android 6.0.1 &amp; Spotify version 8.4.28.875
@SpotifyCares @115888 Hey! Take the feedback, my work is done!
@SpotifyCares So it would be 129 for Mobile charging? Plus good for 3 months already.
@SpotifyCares Okay noted po 😊 But how many device can be use with one account?
@SpotifyCares Alright!! Thank you so much! 😊
@SpotifyCares thank you, you icon
@SpotifyCares But why would it get removed
@SpotifyCares @277952 @SpotifyCares will I ever have a wife?
@SpotifyCares I did try the steps but it randomly happens
@SpotifyCares happens on 4g
@SpotifyCares Woop it worked thanks ❤
@SpotifyCares Yes tried that already. Last time I had this problem I had to reinstall whole application. That is quite annoying to do.
@SpotifyCares I am not able to login (Settings are set to Offline mode) even that I am online (3g or WIFI). https://t.co/lQMfYcYt6M
@SpotifyCares Thanks, will do
@SpotifyCares Finally managed to get the sign up done. Thanks :-)
@SpotifyCares New problem: How do you fix the random alphanumeric username you get assigned? The signup asks "what should we call" but it didn't use it.
@SpotifyCares Done, thanks
@SpotifyCares No luck. Going to try register from the app itself quickly
@SpotifyCares No error. The captcha just times out after 30 sec or so. (Tried now on Edge, IE and Firefox) https://t.co/H6ON9bD59p
@SpotifyCares Forgot to attach the screenshot https://t.co/v4p4BVt2SH
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Also where is the boy band project music? Where can i listen to find that girl by them? https://t.co/CHy2SzaZCh
@SpotifyCares Using chrome incognito already since I use my Facebook to log in. Cashe/cookies cleared so we'll see
@SpotifyCares It's the webplayer because it's my work computer. Nothing to reinstall
@SpotifyCares Definitely checking this out!! Many thanks!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7! I am holding off on their latest software update though. 😜
@SpotifyCares What's the word
@SpotifyCares thank you for your response ☺
@SpotifyCares macOS High Sierra
@SpotifyCares Didn't help. It's an issue with 2014 MBPs, they overheat when there is a fancy animation going on, happens on websites too.
@SpotifyCares :(((
@SpotifyCares Hmm...What's an incognito window?
@SpotifyCares Did it...I'm getting the same error message " enter a valid postal code"
@SpotifyCares thanks for answering!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s, iOS 11.1, Spotify version 8.4.25.906. I️ don’t think it’s updated since initial connect. Am i to do it manually?
@SpotifyCares the original ‘these girls’ by @276220 was taken off of spotify and replaced with this one and i want the original one back
@SpotifyCares Thank you! 💙
@SpotifyCares I'm not sure when it happened, but the tracklist to "Issa Album" by 21 Savage got jumbled up pretty badly. Spotify album link and correct tracklist: https://t.co/KtP0c7Qori | https://t.co/F8PbYJFsXG
@SpotifyCares I was unable to watch the ad. The audio said to tap to watch the ad but there was no option to tap/ it didn't work.
@SpotifyCares It hasn't crashed ever.
@SpotifyCares Thank you 🙏🏽 https://t.co/LbuWAFUZSm
@SpotifyCares Yes. The kind of device I have is a Samsung amp prime, I'm not sure the operating system and I'm using the updated version, but not Spotify premium
@SpotifyCares No, I do not get any error messages.
@SpotifyCares This started happening a while ago. Maybe like 3 months ago or 2. But I'm not sure if it started after an update or anything
@SpotifyCares Well I really wanted to show it to a friend but it was gone
@SpotifyCares 7+, iOS 11.1.1. Spotify 8.4.28. And yes, I didn’t have any videos playing or anything on Twitter or Snap, but the music stops playing.
@SpotifyCares Wait why do you need my email address? I just asked if you could release a certain song. I'm confused 😕
@SpotifyCares It’s an iPhone 6s, iOS 11.1.2 and the Spotify version is 8.4.28
@SpotifyCares Just tried and it looks like it only happens over WIFI. I’m having the same problem when I’m using my Mac and iPad. It skips, pauses or restarts the song randomly.
@SpotifyCares Already did and nothing changed. It happens when I’m connected to WiFi in general, not just the one at home. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it but didn’t work either.
@SpotifyCares I'm on WiFi as I'm in India at the moment. I'm using Android, the latest version on an LG G5 and Spotify version is the lastest release.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I’m using IOS 11.0.2 and Spotify 8.4.20.535. When playing music, it no longer appears in the control centre or on the locked screen.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply
@SpotifyCares I only see 30 days.
@SpotifyCares spotify v8.4.22.857 armv7 android: 7.0 - essentially, say the music paused by pulling my headphones, spotify will kill itself. pls no
@SpotifyCares Restarting doesn't do anything. I don't have another device other than my computers. It just seems like the time out is low
@SpotifyCares I'm already with a very helpful support agent, but I need a good explanation on this very annoying thing to make up mi mind.
@SpotifyCares thank you soooo muchhh❤️
@SpotifyCares Super thanks!
@SpotifyCares All fixed. Thanks for the suggestion.
@SpotifyCares @280183 Hey you guys keep saying that every time people complain about pre-existing customers not getting any deals. Yet y’all still haven’t come out with any deals to thank your long term costumers
@SpotifyCares Yay!!! Incase I don't have a debit nor credit how much will be the additional charge?
@SpotifyCares All this makes me wonder if the expert spotify tech sites are just a spinoff business because of deliberate shoddy support format.  Hmmmm

@SpotifyCares I've just sent a reply if you could check thanks
@SpotifyCares Ok, thanks.
@SpotifyCares Haha it's fine I don't mind it... it's just funny that the only thing to suggest I might like Greek music is my surname
@SpotifyCares done :D
@SpotifyCares You should also do music video support. Spotify would be a even bigger power house. 😎👌🏾
@SpotifyCares Yours even pulls the album artwork from the Shearing album its from, when playing.
@SpotifyCares Will that help me get the promotion?
@SpotifyCares I know how to manually change the queue. My point was the app, which costs money, is missing a useful feature present in virtually every other music app
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 running iOS 11.1.2
@SpotifyCares Okay. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares For debir card no, only shows 129, for credit card yes but there's an error. :'( sent a dm
@SpotifyCares i think i put wrong address when i joined my family plan and now the buyer of the family plan reinvited me and i tried writing right and wrong addresses and still i get this error "Oops something went wrong.... " what should i do?
@SpotifyCares oh sorry to hear that, thank you anyway
@SpotifyCares australia
@SpotifyCares i think you might have figured it out! it's out now. thanks guys. i was expecting a little sooner though, like other albums do. have a good day, happy thanksgiving. unless you're swedish or something ahh
@SpotifyCares DM’d! Thanks
@SpotifyCares Thanks. It just loaded the new songs. It was late tho. It usually comes out at midnight.
@SpotifyCares Perfect. I will today. Thank you
@SpotifyCares yes! Got it. Thank you :)
@SpotifyCares Newest MacBook OS and Spotify 1.0.65.320
@SpotifyCares Nope, it’s really laggy and doesn’t always respond to commands
@SpotifyCares Who’s fault is that?! BRING BACK THE PREVIEWS! iTunes have a preview. All music apps should have it. I don’t ever want to add the wrong song
@SpotifyCares It was a joke, but try clicking "translate", it might be helpful
@SpotifyCares Galaxy S8, Android 7.0, Spotify 8.4.22.857 https://t.co/mK4xZmJOe4

@SpotifyCares My device is Samsung j7 android marshmallow version 6.0 I guess
@SpotifyCares Thank you MU &lt;3
@SpotifyCares On the iOS app I still see suggestions, in desktop browser "discover" is also empty. What is going on ?
@SpotifyCares Succesful. Weird. But thanks.
@SpotifyCares I’m good, I know how to get signed up. (And did.) Just sharing that your current path to upgrade through the native app should be looked at!
@SpotifyCares It's £15 a month a Spotify subscription (family account) and another £15 in data usage (at least!) a month. So essentially i'm paying £30 :(

@SpotifyCares Thank you for the clarification. 😁
@SpotifyCares Ohh right cool 👌🏼 I've seen both series! Great watch!!
@SpotifyCares I dunno I got frustrated and just uninstalled it. Maybe I'll try Spotify again some day.
@SpotifyCares How to make payment via google play?
@SpotifyCares The playlist used to be called ‘4am Comedown’ but you changed the name to ‘The Wind Down’ (lol) but all the songs from 4am Comedown have disappeared and now there are only 50 new songs 😭 did you remove all the songs from the 4am comedown’ playlist 😭 I didn’t get to save them 😭
@SpotifyCares #boycottSpotify x lol jkz x lysm 💘
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately not. I have a feeling it is to do with iOS 11 for the most part as its having real problems even playing gifs and video clips from social media sites/apps.
@SpotifyCares Both over Wi-fi, and mobile data, and with downloaded songs.
@SpotifyCares Ok. Ill give it a go this evening and let you know how I get on.
@SpotifyCares Hi there. Unfortunately it didn’t work. 
Tried the same scenario on my wife’s phone (she’s got the same iOS and app versions). The gif muted the Spotify audio, but it kicked back in afterwards. Tres strange.
@SpotifyCares Set to UK I think, and yeah does the same on my mac too. Doesn’t matter cos I can find a different version of the song, just thought you should know 😀
@SpotifyCares It’s not a “tech” issue. It’s an issue for Product Management. I’d love to know what Spotify PM’s with young children do.
@SpotifyCares Here’s 680K Google results https://t.co/RSQirIhfI9 on “spotify explicit”. Enough of “we’ll be sure to pass it on”. Take action. Seriously.
@SpotifyCares Thx! Was using an iPhone 6s &amp; iOS 11.0.2. The music played, but there was no “now playing” on the carplay screen..had to control from my 📱
@SpotifyCares It works now 😊 thank you!
@SpotifyCares This keeps happening. The Spotify player doesn’t show up on the lock screen, meaning I can’t use my headphones to pause, control volume etc
@SpotifyCares Using an iPhone 6s on latest iOS. Can we show some love for older models that still work fine?? 😫😫
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.515. And yea if I log out &amp; restart, that usually helps but only temporarily. After a few sessions it always goes back this way☹️
@SpotifyCares Cheers, have done so :)
@SpotifyCares I got it to work. Started on my fone and hen moved to the work pc and it seemed to work fine! Thanks for getting back to me so fast!!
@SpotifyCares I've already had that enabled. 1.0.63 sounded nicely, 1.0.64 sounds like someone forgot how to bass.
@SpotifyCares I sent you DM. please let me know if you can help this POOR UNFORTUNATE SOUL!
@SpotifyCares Version 1.0.63.617.g5aca9a2a
Dell Inspiron 5520 running Windows 7 home premium. Won't allow me to uninstall
@SpotifyCares ...don't know why that didn't occur to me https://t.co/PRf88Y39Bk
@SpotifyCares Seems to be working. Preshimate  ya
@SpotifyCares Not at the same time.  I linked my  Spotify account (part of the Family plan) to my Echo and linked my Sonos to my Echo.
@SpotifyCares Clearing the Spotify connection from the Echo app allows desktop and phone app to work, but breaks the Echo/Sonos/Spotify connection
@SpotifyCares Telling Echo to stop playing Spotify on Sonos appears to still count as a playing device
@SpotifyCares I'm on a Dell Inspiron running Windows 10 Home Single Language
@SpotifyCares I use a Samsung Galaxy. No matter what song I play, they all skip multiple times.
@SpotifyCares Spotify 8.4.21.508 running on Galaxy S6 Android Version 7.0
@SpotifyCares When listening to my downloads offline. But the songs still skip whether I'm on Wi-Fi or not.
@SpotifyCares That fixed but now next morning I have the same problem :(
@SpotifyCares No it’s not good. Read my tweet again.
@SpotifyCares not only have I reinstalled the app I have done a iPhone factory reset. Still the same issue.
@SpotifyCares Tried this, but still doesn't work. Still seeing the KFC ad but nothing is playing.
@SpotifyCares Windows 10 and primarily using google chrome (if that helps). Thanks!
@SpotifyCares unfortunately, this didn't work either. :( really missing my spotify during the work day!
@SpotifyCares I've tried signing out and in, restarting my computer, and several different web browsers. :(
@SpotifyCares Why can’t it just be random? We just want random. A playlist of 40 songs and 5 artists coming up like that is awful.
@SpotifyCares It’s the worst thing i have ever experienced.
@SpotifyCares And it's kinda bothering me because I already signed up for premium a week ago. :(
@SpotifyCares Philippines
@SpotifyCares it’s podcast. i cannot hide it or say i don’t like it. on thanksgiving? srsly? https://t.co/79IWjWuEtx
@SpotifyCares Thank you soooo much! You guys are the best ♥️
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you for the response I was just upset to not see the song on there but now I understand why.
@SpotifyCares You said last Christmas. Nothing materialised
A whole algorithm for a simple function that's existed since Discman days, and it's entirely useless. Amazing. @SpotifyCares https://t.co/TcScgZBLBX
@SpotifyCares please fix Shuffle. I have enough music for Shuffle to not be this picky https://t.co/IaSYaZhgqt
@SpotifyCares some sources say it’s launching tomorrow in ro is it true
@SpotifyCares @115888 Fantastic!!! I intend to do just that!😉
@SpotifyCares I’m running iOS 11 on my iPhone, the app didn’t respond couple times but now it’s working fine I don’t know what happed, thanks anyways ✌🏻
@SpotifyCares I’ve been waiting for almost 10 years
@SpotifyCares It worked on incognito mode. Just tried on another phone and the same thing happened..
@SpotifyCares ur the best i’ll never leave you for apple music
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the prompt reply but none of those apply to me
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I mean, not that I don’t like heavy metal but surely wasn’t ready to listen that while listening to an opera singer.
@SpotifyCares Any chance it can renew before then as my family would like to start listening asap?
@SpotifyCares Finding friends on the app is way too hard.. this process should be much easier. On the desktop browser, don't even see that as an option
@SpotifyCares iPhone. Keeps saying someone else is using it but I changed my password and logged every device out
@SpotifyCares No, it’s OK; you’ve been very helpful. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Awww. It's too bad then. I have been 'clean' from illegal downloading even since I'm on Spotify. So thank you!
@SpotifyCares that’s already what your colleagues said in 2014 on a forum where the question was brought up. simple googling here. thanks for nothing
@SpotifyCares Thank you! I found being able to preview a song helpful when checking out new artists and songs I haven’t heard in a while
@SpotifyCares thank you !!!!
@SpotifyCares Thank you kindly! Cheers!
@SpotifyCares pm sent!
@SpotifyCares No error messages. Just stops playing and the play button freezes. Tried refreshing page or playing something different, nothing works.
@SpotifyCares Didn't work
@SpotifyCares Windows 10 and I tried both Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome browsers
@SpotifyCares Sure ya will.... I’m gonna tweet until you fix this!! Music is meant to be universal I pay to listen to music I want and clearly it ain’t
@SpotifyCares It’s actually night time not day time ✌🏼
@SpotifyCares Well I added @289430 to tweet I’m sure she can see it get her to have a word!! If you cared you would try! 😂😂 it’s frustrating my life!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, iOS 10.2, Spotify 8.4.4.884
@SpotifyCares No I can hear them but it chunks them. E.g all songs added last week play together then move on to all songs added today. They do not mix.
@SpotifyCares So I can't change it?
@SpotifyCares ... and worked fine until about an hour ago when I updated Spotify.
@SpotifyCares 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02, and Sonos 8.0.
@SpotifyCares Hey gang, running Spotify 8.4.21.508 on Pixel running Oreo. Sharing a track crashes the app and dumps me at the home screen. Help!
@SpotifyCares It just stopped playing music and If I started playing music.. It wouldn't even play! Well now it fixed itself and I'm happy
@SpotifyCares @128606  https://t.co/6bncpNuDG8
@SpotifyCares I did both process and still stopping...
@SpotifyCares Now works, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Yes, that's what I meant
@SpotifyCares Thanks just sent.
@SpotifyCares Afraid not. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and redownloaded the playlists also.
@SpotifyCares Yay, thank you! And, just so you know, I love This is: playlist series 😄
@SpotifyCares OK, I will! 🙂
@SpotifyCares It recently updated to the newest version of Spotify and I have it on a laptop.
@SpotifyCares It does not. I even uninstalled and reinstalled.
@SpotifyCares Thank you but I think this is the one I am voting for :) https://t.co/8z2o25Wcsh
@SpotifyCares Thanks but 
1)no drum n bass playlists
2)doesn’t mix/cross-fade like the Stepping Out playlist 
😞
@SpotifyCares It's all good, Patrisha G on spotify help chat has got me in. 👍 Thanks
@SpotifyCares Songs will occasionally just stop. When I say "Hey Google play X" it responds with "Sorry, we're having trouble connecting."
@SpotifyCares v1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 - Thought it might be my internet, but haven't seen anything else having issues.
@SpotifyCares Thank you. I just sent a message to this link.
@SpotifyCares I can t send you a private message, my screen turns dark grey-shows like a filter on top of the screen ...
@SpotifyCares that s what it looks like https://t.co/QwM0GOziWw
@SpotifyCares Im on samsung j7 and its acting like it dosent know where my music is saved i have not switched any sd cards and memory is not full
@SpotifyCares You how there is space in the middle. I was thinking putting a "add to library" plus sign(+) would be new. Maybe???? https://t.co/HIoLrWcnTb
@SpotifyCares Let’s hope!! Thanks.
@SpotifyCares I'm really confused rn it says regional at best is gone and all of a sudden it's a artist with 2 albums,?? Which are actually songs?
@SpotifyCares By responding to my private message please! 

I'm need help with a subscription I am being charged for that I do not have!
@SpotifyCares Sent a DM
@SpotifyCares It is done https://t.co/hZEGqxbOFm

@SpotifyCares Havent tried if it works yet but will tonight
@SpotifyCares seems to work fine
@SpotifyCares Might be the device i never turn it off 😂
@SpotifyCares The version says 8.4.11.1283
@SpotifyCares Lg k4 (2017) android marshmellow and unsure spodify version hang on
@SpotifyCares I feel like a dork, but I just turned my phone on and off again and now it works 😂
@SpotifyCares I have an iPhone 6S and I have premium, but idk what operating system 😅
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Can you please answer the attached questions for me? Please remember: I'm a #WindowsPhone user who's loved #Groove since its launch. https://t.co/FMpiuUbBi7
@SpotifyCares It has not been updated (Version 1.1) since March 20th
@SpotifyCares It's been 7 Months why should I believe you guys are doing anything about it?
@SpotifyCares Uh yea this was posted in March and you tweet this at every person who complains. Why don't you just fix it already?
@SpotifyCares For a service that I pay money for monthly this is beyond disappointing. How could anyone justify this- it is a sad sad excuse for an app
@SpotifyCares I’m still waiting on my student discount to be applied I am still paying regular price.
@SpotifyCares My friend got a playlist added to his account of all the songs he was sent, can you do the same for me?
@SpotifyCares Again... https://t.co/spJx6EOmQv
@SpotifyCares I noticed it here and there about a month ago. It's been a daily occurrence since 10/6, though.
@SpotifyCares Happens with 4g as well as WiFi.
@SpotifyCares An Samsung S8 Active as of Friday. Prior to that, the S6 Active. And I must say, great customer service and support, props to y'all!! https://t.co/JwYBvXSGQQ
@SpotifyCares Hey /LO. Chrome(book), WiFi.
@SpotifyCares That didn't help...
@SpotifyCares @115888 None of those solutions help me in my situation, so I slide up in y'all's DMs explaining the sitch and someone hits me with the reset password nonsense. I tried that already homie, so I RE-EXPLAIN my sitch and they send me back to the FAQs and tell me to email. I literally copy
@SpotifyCares Student price in Québec is unavailable. Why?!
@SpotifyCares Thanks I’m not mad at you I just can’t stand Primus and I’ve been a member for 5 years.
@SpotifyCares Where's the link button to sign up using debit card? I don't see any options in spotify app?
@SpotifyCares Hi the option for payment still for credit card users. I don't see any options for payment by debit card. https://t.co/sr1eRjn3f1
@SpotifyCares Hi, when will the spotify for students can be purchased by transfer via atm since a few of students in indonesia doesn't have credit card?
@SpotifyCares I was just wondering what the Stranger Things Modus is :) ?
@SpotifyCares Cool, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Sure ok
@SpotifyCares My email is __email__
@SpotifyCares Hey! Yeah I noticed it while ago! Thanks!☺️
@SpotifyCares Tell them if thru want talent in NYC I'm the guy to book it for them.
@SpotifyCares Cool
@SpotifyCares Yeah I do, just these two songs (just noticed another repeat offender 😅) keep popping up. If the team come back with something let me know 👍
@SpotifyCares Tyty nice to know y'all #cares
@SpotifyCares @292847 @115888 I would also like to know!
@SpotifyCares It's been taken care of, thanks though!
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/vnuNzFyRX5
@SpotifyCares How can I check how many I have? And is there a way to get more?
@SpotifyCares I found it! The version is 8.4.22.857 armV7
@SpotifyCares No. I already tried that...
@SpotifyCares Seems to be working! Thank you🤘
@SpotifyCares Yessss
@SpotifyCares No error messages - this hasn’t happened before. I’m using an iPhone 7+ with iOS 11.0.2 and version 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares @199853 I would never buy @115888 ever, what a shitty company. I am so bust there balls for being thieves.
@SpotifyCares I just installed Spotify &amp; disappointed there's no option to auto-play video while streaming music as there was with Groove
@SpotifyCares Oh! Thanks for the quick reply! 😊💚
@SpotifyCares I'll cancel my subscription before it renews then. Thanks for coming back to me anyway. 
Hi @115948 how you doin'?
@SpotifyCares UniDays doesn't support my education provider, which is why I bought an NUS card. As I already have spotify student, can I just renew?
@SpotifyCares Nothing. Nothing is happening. That’s the problem.
@SpotifyCares Should be under USA
@SpotifyCares It just stalls here. I have tried restarting and killing the app. My work colleague who also has android and premium alsp has this issue. https://t.co/YpwHhT41WB
@SpotifyCares Startup
@SpotifyCares i cant see the full title of the tracks https://t.co/lONrcJqzNR
@SpotifyCares Hi, I cant find an Indosat option to buy spotify premium.
@SpotifyCares And no, it's not the internet connection, I'm Youtubing music instead with no such issues
@SpotifyCares Logged out, cleared cache, restarted Chrome, logged back in. Song took 2 minutes to start playing, stalled after 10 seconds
@SpotifyCares Work PC, LAN connection. Router settings are out of my hands.
@SpotifyCares hahaha well it SAYS I'm in private mode but still updates my recently played artists.  I thought private session disabled that?
@SpotifyCares When I click on my favs : https://t.co/KCDkvIn6dl it redirect me to the login page.. always..
@SpotifyCares Nop, no error messages
@SpotifyCares Google Chrome.. I have this problem since 1/2 week...
@SpotifyCares Nop, it does not help.. __email__ is my account
@SpotifyCares Done
@SpotifyCares Not better with both solutions
@SpotifyCares The confirmation email to remove my account. Made my through Facebook, but want to unlink with FB, so want to make a new account.
@SpotifyCares Oops. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Yes. I tried registering for unidays found the institute but it said they weren't supported.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/9cuT63nyCx
@SpotifyCares @260711 don't support my provider so can't use them. Am I just meant to wait until they sort that out?
@SpotifyCares Nevermind.  I cancelled my subscription.  I’ll renew it if you give it back.
@SpotifyCares I know that Microsoft and Spotify are good partners. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Yeah right
@SpotifyCares Notging. Just go back to the previous Web Player...
@SpotifyCares thanks so much! would really appreciate that ☺️
@SpotifyCares Nope, no error message at all. I never restarting my device yet. Should I try it first?
@SpotifyCares My phone is Samsung A8,  android and spotify 8.4.21.508 armV7 version.
@SpotifyCares Hi! The quality of the song Pwede Ba by Soapdish sounds pretty bad. Can you upload a better copy? Thanks!
@SpotifyCares How come my account has been paused? I’m the only one using Spotify. Only music I’ve been listening to has been played Why does this appear?
@SpotifyCares My Spotify keeps logging out and I can’t play music from my lock screen. How come? iPhone 7 and updated
@SpotifyCares I’m running the latest version of iOS
@SpotifyCares I'm using iPhone 7 and have the latest version installed
@SpotifyCares Wi-fi, and it happens on two different iMacs, one running yosemite one running sierra on different connections :( Also happens in chrome
@SpotifyCares It's been an ongoing problem for a few weeks now, I have to keep restarting the desktop app, reloading the web app etc. periodically
@SpotifyCares Nothing. It just suddenly stops.
@SpotifyCares Happens on both. Restarted my phone already.
@SpotifyCares Seems to have done it 🤷‍♀️
It was defaulting to Apple Music’s widget before meaning Spotify was unresponsive. 
Simple solve - thanks!! https://t.co/uPKvW4w0XD
@SpotifyCares It’s 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares It's cool, the old delete/install worked.
@SpotifyCares Its fixed thank you i think i just pit wrong login there
@SpotifyCares Accounts sorted it for me 😊 thank you
@SpotifyCares None of the criteria matches my situation, I had 2 offline devices only. This the second time in 2 weeks.
@SpotifyCares I only download albums. I removed all offline devices and will download again
@SpotifyCares This is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened to me in the last few months. Also my phone still says all that storage is still being used
@SpotifyCares None of those apply to me. It only undownloaded some of the tracks from all the albums I downloaded https://t.co/PcEq5ydLrg
@SpotifyCares 4 songs in and it just froze 🤔
@SpotifyCares Device - Alcatel One Touch Pixi 4
Android - 6.0.1
App version - 8.4.24.871
@SpotifyCares Yes I have. When it freezes I switch off my phone and then I switch it back on, then it works. Shouldn't be like this.
@SpotifyCares It's pretty annoying ngl. I'm on PC using Win10 Spotify version 1.0.66.478.g1296534d which seems to be the latest
@SpotifyCares yes!
@SpotifyCares 1.0.20.101
@SpotifyCares Hello, guys
It is 8.4.22.857 armV7 

I hope I can help you https://t.co/czkXpxGXEb
@SpotifyCares Oh, thank you! 
If you need some test or some log just let me now
Love you guys :-)
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares I've tried logging into my account through Facebook and through my regular info and it won't work. Also does not let my music play on PS4
@SpotifyCares Yeah I do. I unplugged my router and now it’s working again. But thanks anyways 👍🏾
@SpotifyCares @296859 well this sucks :(
@SpotifyCares Hi! Thank you for the quick reply. And I hope so, too. Can’t wait for it
@SpotifyCares So basically what I'm trying to say is: I do not want to purchased twice on this goddamn month.
@SpotifyCares For previous subscription, I used a number which was deactivated and I don't want any informations to be key in.
@SpotifyCares I’m not really sure how to explain, I can’t even find the button on my desktop anymore! I guess can you tell me how 2 manage queue playback?
@SpotifyCares So should I remove tracks to empty the queue then?
@SpotifyCares Okay thanks so much for the help!!
@SpotifyCares am trying to stream it online
@SpotifyCares I'm using my spotify desktop on windows 7 PC
@SpotifyCares just said it was the desktop app mate
@SpotifyCares 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares why should I uninstall my spotify ?
@SpotifyCares When the songs are changing that’s not me changing the songs that is literally that person changing the song not me.
@SpotifyCares i need your support on this one
@SpotifyCares yes hello what spotify playlist should i listen to when angry
@SpotifyCares Ok.. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares just the Spotify app :(
@SpotifyCares did the former and it keeps coming back. will try to reinstall later this week
@SpotifyCares Did you hear any feedback from the people you passed the feedback on to regarding my feedback? #feedback
@SpotifyCares Great! I'll expect the old webplayer early next week. Thanks a lot for your help, have a great weekend!
@SpotifyCares Doesn’t help. https://t.co/vowhQaLSwy
@SpotifyCares For now that seems to have helped. But let’s see in a few hours.
@SpotifyCares Only on High Sierra. I’m on version: https://t.co/F0GjjZIdo2
@SpotifyCares Cheers for the reply, and my suggestion for a long press feature is the old one lol :)
@SpotifyCares MacBook pro 2015 on Google chrome
@SpotifyCares I noticed it today and I'm on private university wifi where each person has their own connection
@SpotifyCares I will have it open in its own tab from now on, it seems to be working right now
@SpotifyCares Ppl online complaining about iOS and desktop; desktop is working for me. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling Android app; error continues.
@SpotifyCares Several people complaining about similar issues with same discographies in Spotify community boards. Any update?
@SpotifyCares Hi there.  I'm using the Spotify desktop computer download (ON Windows 7), Spotify version: 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02.  Thnx!!
@SpotifyCares Absolutely -- apreciate your help!  :)  spotify:album:6f1N5L3IFE2IQmUlwkVpV6  (sidenote: I have the album in my library, play it on repeat!)
@SpotifyCares How odd; wonder why two tracks are subject to different arrangements to the other 11? This kind of thing gets me thinking lol.  Thanks, AY
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/gHw1DOImzm and my account is a UK one.  Was searching for his song 'Pray' which is track #9 and it's curious I can't see it!
@SpotifyCares That being said not all names are incorrect...
@SpotifyCares Thank you! It made me jump the first time I heard it at work
@SpotifyCares Thx
@SpotifyCares You need to nix the 10,000 song limit in collections. I have over 15,000 songs in my Groove collection. #soweakdude
@SpotifyCares Sure thing.
@SpotifyCares omg thank you so much! That did help thxs
@SpotifyCares Google pixle, how do I find tye version, and it would be Facebook and Twitter but that page doesn't show, only blank and back to the song.
@SpotifyCares Ok, I have a question. MS said we "can" get a 60 day free trial but when I do upgrade option it only offers 30 days.
@SpotifyCares Yes the album is by the artist Hardwired and has a song called The Game. Right now it says the Artist is The Game with a feat from Hardwired
@SpotifyCares I thought @33406 released new stuff 😢 feelsbadman
@SpotifyCares Oh relax man, it was an irrelevant mistake. Now the servers work so fine!
@SpotifyCares actually all is going through my account: __email__, thanks!
@SpotifyCares So if I follow someone they will end up in the New Releases?
@SpotifyCares Tried both Chrome: Version 61.0.3163.100 (Official Build) (64-bit) and 57.0b7 (64-bit) on Linux, also Chrome on Chromebook.
@SpotifyCares And did I mention that it is loading for ages?
@SpotifyCares And did I mention I have to do a restart of the device, because it is still not working?
@SpotifyCares No, but I've moved speaker to about 1 metre away and it's not skipping at the mo - it was about 3 or 4 metres away before. Fingers crossed!
@SpotifyCares Brilliant thanks 😊
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Version 8.4.22.857 armv7 on anker bluetooth speaker on Samsung Galaxy Tab A (2016) Model SM-T280 Does distance from speaker matter?
@SpotifyCares Agreed, I have the same info. I moved music, registered, hit upgrade... It says 30 days vs 60 days. https://t.co/K6tiMuyJ1F
@SpotifyCares Thank you for listening. Service is so slow here I only get a couple hundred songs before it deletes them again.
@SpotifyCares It just said to browse for music as if i never added a song before.
@SpotifyCares My songs randomly came back. But all my songs were gone. My playlists existed and songs were in them. But nothing in songs/albums/artists
@SpotifyCares for sure, it's been there a few years :D Enjoy choosing the winner!
@SpotifyCares yeah but until Spotify is available in our country not much I can do 😇 A friend of mine tells me often he cannot wait to hear my playlists
@SpotifyCares @16134 Jealous that I cannot enter lol
@SpotifyCares Not very happy, if this is not fixed I will pass on the word on shitty you guys are.
@SpotifyCares Microsoft windows 10 home, Spotify version 1.0.65.320
@SpotifyCares lol it's no big deal. Yeah what technology is is programmed in? Nah I'm not gonna restart, too busy listening to music :p
@SpotifyCares Okay, hmm, thank you.
@SpotifyCares I don't have any, and it's not cache data either
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares Pixel, andriod 8.0, Spotify mobile from playstore up to date
@SpotifyCares Never mind, my kid pranked me. Lowered the volume in the Xbox home #HesGrounded
@SpotifyCares 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares I've done that countless times...I was schooled long ago, "when all else fails....REBOOT!"
@SpotifyCares UGH! That means I have to open it again...I'll let you know in an hour...when it's open (paying for this)! For now..#Youtube for Music!
@SpotifyCares I just submitted my idea. I hope it gets taken into consideration. I love using my Spotify and getting my playlists out there. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Yes there is. If you need some music in your life, feel free to check out my playlists on Spotify under the name youngpun1 or Andrew. 😉
@SpotifyCares I was using mobile so that could be it.
@SpotifyCares It keeps saying there's errors when trying to submit it. It looks like it's forcing me to use an attatchment.
@SpotifyCares akskdkd it's okay 😅
@SpotifyCares All our Fire TVs have unique names, but just show up the same. My sibling also has this problem on her iPhone. This is a weird glitch. Thx.
@SpotifyCares Spotify version 8.4.3.844 
iPhone 6 iOS 9.3.3
@SpotifyCares When I navigate to Spotify, the screen doesn’t load. I tried allowing pop ups and flash on the site settings.
@SpotifyCares Yes but the only song on it is loser. Other songs like Pay No Mind and Beercan aren't there!
@SpotifyCares Oh right! Thanks verry much for your answer (that's kind of rare nowadays 🙌) #ThumbsUp
@SpotifyCares Its been a month trying to get a response to fixing an error on my artist account. I need songs merged to my verified account.
@SpotifyCares Oh thank you for the information!
@SpotifyCares Nothing...
@SpotifyCares Still don't work
@SpotifyCares I do not use the app, only the online version and my device is up to date.
@SpotifyCares No, it still does not play anything
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/lJGGoV5BJx
@SpotifyCares they are totally different issues. One is about wanting to be able to relabel devices. My issue is all the devices being given the same name
@SpotifyCares You guys basically did the same.... “if and when” https://t.co/njVfXzrRF1
@SpotifyCares I just don't get why you closed my ticket as a "duplicate" when its a different showstopper issue. That and amazon refusing my 1 star review
@SpotifyCares Nexus 6P, Android Oreo with latest security patch, Spotify version 8.4.22.857 armV7
@SpotifyCares Algeria, pleeeeaaase make it happen!
@SpotifyCares I'm not on my PC which is where this issue was occurring. It's Track 8 on With Teeth by Nine Inch Nails.
UK
@SpotifyCares No issue on Android app on phone. Could be interference from local files on desktop?
@SpotifyCares I've monitored the desktop experience and the problem hasn't gone away. It's a bug with your software. Is this a known issue?
@SpotifyCares Ty, should be a way to streamline the process though. Send it out like a snap. Real quick they get a notification which opens app
@SpotifyCares i'm running the latest version of the app and a pixel with whatever the latest version of android is.
@SpotifyCares No I get it but I mean... when can I listen to Josie and the Pussycats soundtrack on Spotify?
@SpotifyCares Give me Rap and Grime :)
@SpotifyCares Both Artists music fall under the Title of "Dustin" I think @193163 might be around longer than the other so should keep the title
@SpotifyCares Nor do I see the icon for Spotify in the corner of my phone anymore when music is playing.
@SpotifyCares Also, I no longer get that mini screen on the push notifications screen on my phone where I can change songs without changing apps,
@SpotifyCares It worked! Thank you
@SpotifyCares Please do it, so many people it! 👍🏼
@SpotifyCares I mean for starters there’s no discover page, my playlists don’t show, you can’t queue songs, and there’s no discover page or radio.
@SpotifyCares You swear like I didn’t already google this 💁🏽‍♂️ I’m hearing excuses but w/e its all good tho I guess https://t.co/rlo471WrgN
@SpotifyCares I'm fine thanks.
@SpotifyCares Linx 1010b, latest windows 10 OS, latest Spotify from Microsoft store. Chromecast audio gen 2.
@SpotifyCares 1.0.66.478.g1296534d (Windows Store version)
@SpotifyCares Don’t you think I tried that! As soon as you type in the issue and try to chat it sends you to a unknown website. Multiple times
@SpotifyCares Pixel XL, Android 8.0.0, Spotify 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares Can't screenshot. When I find a song to share, when I choose "share," it closes. No error message.
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Google Pixel. Spotify version 8.4.22.875 armV7
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares i open the app and it just immediately closes as if it was never opened.
@SpotifyCares I have an iPhone 6s running iOS 11.0.2 and Spotify version 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares I tried that but it didn’t help fix the problem
@SpotifyCares Fixed 😁 for now!
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.2 and Spotify version 8.4.20 . Every time I try to shuffle my playlist it’ll shuffle for 2 songs and then play my playlist in order.
@SpotifyCares Alright, I tried that and it’s still doing the same thing https://t.co/Li25yOzgP6
@SpotifyCares It looks like that worked. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Using Spotify 0.2.4?
@SpotifyCares Restart had no effect. Had to download it, again... #weird working now.
@SpotifyCares Thank you, switching to an incognito window seems to have solved the problem.
@SpotifyCares TL; DR “Not Right Now” 👎🏽
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your help!
@SpotifyCares payment for student premium only via credit card or there will be another way?
@SpotifyCares but there is no option for debit card https://t.co/zH08wdiW6U
@SpotifyCares I've been experiencing this since april and I just found this @SpotifyCares on twitter today. I already uninstalled and reinstalled spotify
@SpotifyCares Hello
@SpotifyCares 😩😩😔😔😭😭😭 Alright thanks for your help!!
@SpotifyCares @305196 We don't care same info, we need you fix it!
@SpotifyCares Used CDBaby to distribute with you.They say it's been delivered to you, but it's not up on our artist page yet. Any ideas? Release date 2day
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your help team!!! I'll get onto them
@SpotifyCares I have had your premium service included with my @5167 services for a long time. I was suddenly shut down to free. They say it’s you
@SpotifyCares The songs in my library.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6S, IOS 11, app version 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares It worked! Thank you 🤗
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Hope it's fixed 💚
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/DlPSmhllhY
@SpotifyCares yay! thanks mate
@SpotifyCares please i need it in my country
@SpotifyCares Hello @115888, this is still a problem with both my account and my fiancee’s account. Saved songs are all someone else’s pop songs
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the help!
@SpotifyCares Hi, Android phone and mac laptop. I've logged out of everything/reinstalled etc keeps happening. Looks like this https://t.co/QNcvMsbXVj
@SpotifyCares Turns out it was a pending app update, restarting and updating did the trick. Guessing cache of some description. fixT!
@SpotifyCares Thanks @SpotifyCares and keep up the great work :-)
@SpotifyCares Yes but I've had to do this for each of my releases. There has to be a better way.
@SpotifyCares Version 1.64.403.0 from the windows 10 store. Happens regularily, sometimes it works, sometimes not... But it always works on the lockscreen
@SpotifyCares sometimes it works, sometimes not. I think I don't have other apps than Spotify running which need to listen to these media keys
@SpotifyCares not when the pc is unlocked then the play/pause key on the keyboard doesn't work...
@SpotifyCares Galaxy Note 5 - spotify version, I have no clue but I am definitely not going to continue to pay for something I can't use. Too many options
@SpotifyCares 3/4 of my personal playlist was deleted
@SpotifyCares I'm using Spotify 8.4.22.857 on a Nexus 6p running Android 8.0.0
@SpotifyCares . @115888 I don't need to vote for a sleep timer, just add the damn thing already. #UpAllNight #SleepSpotifySleep
@SpotifyCares What is that one based on, what I listen to and similar or literally random based on the general public?
@SpotifyCares Thanks, @spotifycares. That's what I hoped to do, but it looks like the gift cards can't be used to pay for Premium for Family, right?
@SpotifyCares Hi, so I wanted to purchase a premium that's 4.990/3months. But is it only available for Credit Card? How about Debit Card?
@SpotifyCares I've tried that list already.
@SpotifyCares lol ... see? @GooglePlayMusic @122986 @20734
@SpotifyCares well thats some bullshit
@SpotifyCares Thank you but it's been almost a year &amp; half now 😭😭😭 at least get Formation pleaseee 🙏🏼🙏🏼
@SpotifyCares This is the same reply template from 2 years ago. Come on guys.
@SpotifyCares no, rather an UX issues. app makes it easy to browser around and get inspired. UX it's subpar if you'r looking for something specific.
@SpotifyCares Done, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Problem was resolved.  I logged in on another device and was able to update.  Thanks for getting back!
@SpotifyCares Thnx! Samsung s7 g930f Android 7.0 Spotify 8.4.14.439 armV7
@SpotifyCares It didn't work. With wifi I have no prob but as soon as I go out, it becomes literally crazy :(
@SpotifyCares Headphones
@SpotifyCares I dont know if it has an inline remote but it actually works OK with other headphones. Why?? Thank you!
@SpotifyCares (2/2) Spanish in Brazil haha
@SpotifyCares It seems to have straightened itself out on my phone. The PC issue may be due to firewall settings. Thank you for the reply!
@SpotifyCares Hah, just me being silly with wordplay! But good to see you're on the ball. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares All sorted now, thanks
@SpotifyCares thank you! i am on the web player.
@SpotifyCares hmm, yes, it's working incognito. any idea why? thanks!
@SpotifyCares catalog songs...the local files are the only ones that remain available for offline listening, thanks.
@SpotifyCares Similar to bullet points 3 + 4, but in my case it happens whenever the app updates...(after the update is installed). This is by design?
@SpotifyCares I don’t know what that means. Here’s a screenshot of what’s going on now (this started when the app was updated in the App Store).
@SpotifyCares Sorry here: https://t.co/p5037LzZkx
@SpotifyCares No help what do ever
@SpotifyCares I've got Windows 10 with the latest version (since it auto updates)
@SpotifyCares No, that doesn’t work. Your app blocks swiping-up and swiping-left from the edges of the screen.
@SpotifyCares I’ve done that and it’s still just as slow, I’ve uninstalled the app, logged out and back in but the slow speeds remain
@SpotifyCares thanks for the quick response! great to see the idea has already been picked up :)
@SpotifyCares I pressed "Learn More" and then "Get Started" and then it takes me to a screen to edit credit card info.  Don't see another option.
@SpotifyCares Still does nothing about the nonsense username you forced on me.
@SpotifyCares Happens pretty regularly when I shuffle play an artist who has normal and deluxe of same album
@SpotifyCares Appreciate the reply, but all interactive platforms (esp. w/ paid subscribers) should allow blocking. Seems like a basic, beta phase idea.
@SpotifyCares Have also tried clearing all my cookies but it made no difference.
@SpotifyCares No. No error message either. This is my screen. Whatever I click the play bar is stuck on that song. https://t.co/unnWbBrzNW
@SpotifyCares I've tried incognito to no avail. I can't restart the router as I'm on a shared network in a university. Had the same problems at...
@SpotifyCares ...home last night so I'm not sure if it's a network problem. Could try later this evening though.
@SpotifyCares I'm using the web player and have tried Chrome and Firefox on Windows 7 and Chrome on Mac OSX
@SpotifyCares yeah I've done all that deleted cache, uninstalled and reinstalled as well
@SpotifyCares Awesome. It's been going on for a couple days. Here's the application version I'm running. https://t.co/UDRaqCUenk
@SpotifyCares I already tried, and deleted spotify and install it again and still the same issue. And it's only on my computer not on the mobile device.
@SpotifyCares I hope that this is what you meant, if so here you go! https://t.co/ngiotHAtRM
@SpotifyCares I'm using windows desktop spotify, version: 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02. And I have spotify family premium
@SpotifyCares my username is onesimpledot
@SpotifyCares Improvements haven't been noticed on the consumers end. A quick Google search shows ppl are upset about this, and have been for years.
@SpotifyCares Fix your shit. Google "Spotify shuffle problem" and you will see that people aren't satisfied.
@SpotifyCares It seems to be an app specific issue. As in, only one app's notifications pause playback on Spotify
@SpotifyCares The app pausing Spotify constantly is @116584 's Dasher app for drivers, here's screenshots of my phone and app info https://t.co/x1rnfmh6Zz
@SpotifyCares Not sure if any apps updated or not, but I just noticed this happening yesterday. Doordash doesn't interupt my other music player, Poweramp
@SpotifyCares Doesn't look like Spotify updated in the past couple days, only @116584's awful app
@SpotifyCares 5 minutes anymore. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for checking!
@SpotifyCares iphone 6
@SpotifyCares wtf no girl tell them to add it back
@SpotifyCares i need my downloads back tho, thats hella songs
@SpotifyCares Ah. It's back.
@SpotifyCares Afraid not (didn't think it would). It's really quite irritating, I can't ignore that huge blue banner. https://t.co/e408rmaUbd
@SpotifyCares Now that I've timestamped this, I can let you know if/when it happens. I did just install an update!
@SpotifyCares It's like it goes away for a while, but then comes back eventually.
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately that means I will be subscribing to Apple Music, a family account not suitable for a family not the best idea !!
@SpotifyCares Have a read of forum yourself and give a reason why it hasn’t been done with so many people wanting the same thing
@SpotifyCares Perhaps you need to give them a harder nudge or a kick; try reading the forums. You are losing customers over this.
@SpotifyCares be honest you have no intention of adding this feature, requested 6 years ago. and no update from you do spotify really care?
@SpotifyCares I figured it out. It took a few tried, but I'm good now  thank you.
@SpotifyCares cool, thanks...I've been using Spotify for years now, any chance of a cheeky discount code? ;-)
@SpotifyCares I've had premium for years!! Just wanted to pay annually instead of monthly. Sad there is no loyalty bonus, thats all!
@SpotifyCares I haven't decided to stay with you yet ;-)
@SpotifyCares Thanks! iPhone 6S running 10.3.3, Spotify version 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares I got a pop-up asking me what device to play from (mentioned something about Chrome I had never seen before). I chose my device. Today.
Oh, it only applies to Time Capsule? @SpotifyCares Doing some A B testing hmm?
@SpotifyCares Ah, so rather than being a testing ground, it's actually just specifically for Time Capsule?
@SpotifyCares Wow, I really don't do twitter much anymore, just saw this now. It often doesn't load my library, the artists are there but no music.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/0q2ko7Sawd there you go ✌️
@SpotifyCares I didn't get the pin after purchased 1 month premium package via Indosat credit. Why?
@SpotifyCares Thank you!! My username should just be alexaisquaking
@SpotifyCares if I log in and out I'd have to re download ALL of my songs again . not cool.
@SpotifyCares 6S ios 11.1 (it happened even before I updated)
@SpotifyCares I am, however,  it comes back automatically
@SpotifyCares I just saw you have changed that. Now it says Saved in your Library
@SpotifyCares Ok, thanks. But it should be easier. There should be a folder “My downloads” as when I save sthg, the alert says “Saved in Your Downloads”
@SpotifyCares I can‘t get a Swedish credit card, though, since I don‘t have a Personnummer. Is there another way for me to pay?
@SpotifyCares I've restarted a bunch. I'll try logging in and out. Thank!
@SpotifyCares Morning! I just tried the two above options and Spotify still isn't loading in my control center.
@SpotifyCares Didn't work :(
@SpotifyCares I don't think it's your issue anymore! I think apple is trash
@SpotifyCares Although if all you can do is tweak it, please fix the Search cursor so that it moves one space at a time. Maddening how it jumps around.
@SpotifyCares I'm not personally having trouble with it. It's just so bare-bones and misguided. Wouldn't most people want their playlists and saved music?
@SpotifyCares Nope
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s. Version 8.4.2. Wifi/lte
@SpotifyCares I might take you up on the offer now! - since IOS11 I cant control music from the lock screen, cant skip songs or see the music playing!
@SpotifyCares It does yeah, but the problem returns usually quite quickly. Not sure if it’s an IOS problem? Lots of people on Twitter report same thing
@SpotifyCares Tried both at the gym on 4g and at home on WiFi and both the same... 🤔
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your quick reply but panic over!! I’m logged in and enjoying the tunes once again 😎
@SpotifyCares why don't you have this available on the app? 👀
@SpotifyCares They're korean band and all of their songs are bop fyi, please include that band on your app and thank you
@SpotifyCares Android Moto G v5.1 for the device. Spotify v8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares (2/2) When I go to resync it to Chromecast, it says "For premium users only". It's my own device.
@SpotifyCares I've had to change the Chromecast to YouTube or Twitch just to turn the Spotify Chromecast off.
@SpotifyCares It's fixed now. https://t.co/QBOrLbs7L0
@SpotifyCares Dude you have removed so many songs recently.
@SpotifyCares Gary B.B. Coleman - The Sky is Crying
@SpotifyCares It is an #amazing album. @35357 at his finest
@SpotifyCares It is on Spotify, has been since Friday
@SpotifyCares I already send message to DM.
@SpotifyCares thought I'd retry just now, but cannot even login - I login using Facebook, but it keeps routing me back to signin page
@SpotifyCares I'm running Spotify 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 on macOS Sierra version 10.12.6. Also on a Huawei P9 Lite, Android 7.0, Spotify 8.4.22.857 armV7
@SpotifyCares Yes, both devices, and both Wifi and 3G/4G.
@SpotifyCares If it’s not on my Spotify by 12 am I’m letting that chopper hit The-Dream Falsetto
@SpotifyCares Woooord
@SpotifyCares Im in the US, It just uploaded and I'm listening to it now! Thank you &lt;3
@SpotifyCares ... only to have the issue repeat itself. 2/2
@SpotifyCares Hey I DM’d you guys early this morning w/no response yet…. what’s going on?
@SpotifyCares Newest spotify v. Newest OS on Mac. Newest v. of chrome. Mostly links shared in FB music groups. Rather than open app, they open browser.
@SpotifyCares Android 5.0.2 &amp; Spotify 8.4.22.857 arm V7
@SpotifyCares Seems to be working now thanks :)
@SpotifyCares Thank you. I was wondering why some countries can listen to more songs. I hope it'll be available in my country some day :D
@SpotifyCares also, I tried to reset my password and the link you sent me isn't valid...
@SpotifyCares Everything seems to be fine again right now. Restart wasn't needed. I tried removing the spotify cookies yesterday (didn't work though).
@SpotifyCares Music for everyone 👊🏻
@SpotifyCares please could you help me!
@SpotifyCares i been trying about 6 time &amp; no sound
@SpotifyCares it just happen today right now &amp; i can't take screenshots because i don't have a camera 📷. i only have Xbox one Kinect
@SpotifyCares on my Xbox one system
@SpotifyCares A good few hundred maybe 1000+
@SpotifyCares Send
@SpotifyCares One Plus 3T, Oxygen OS, Spotify version 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares Yep, that helped. Cheers!
@SpotifyCares I get it. When you own your own streaming services, I guess you'd want your music there.
@SpotifyCares I need a Spotify account and I’m broke help me 😂
@SpotifyCares Any updates this is really annoying
@SpotifyCares FYI this hasn’t been fixed still having issue with downloaded songs being choppy it sounds like a cd with scratches what’s up 🤷🏻‍♂️#Spotify
@SpotifyCares FYI the update you put out yesterday didn’t correct the issue 😡😡😡😡
@SpotifyCares Just tried that and still having the issue this morning
@SpotifyCares Nice one, thanks for your help!
@SpotifyCares It;s the UK!
@SpotifyCares wow, spotify cares.
@SpotifyCares It's a Lenovo laptop running on Windows 8, and I think it's version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 (that's what I got from Help &gt; About Spotify)
@SpotifyCares Yes restarting my computer helps but I don't like the idea of restarting my PC just so I could run Spotify.
@SpotifyCares No, I’m good! My mistake. Although, if you can make it that I can listen to music all day without using any battery, I would love that! ;)
@SpotifyCares I can understand the ux of always going to searches immediately, when typing has started, but going to Recent on blanking is just really bad
@SpotifyCares If I click back button, then click 'x' to clear search input, jumps me to Recent Searches again.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/PK0oMT6zVz
@SpotifyCares yep, but iys haooen too often
@SpotifyCares yeah, especially catalog from 70/80/90s
@SpotifyCares .... being able to block certain artists from showing up on your DW is like extremely basic level shit you could offer.
@SpotifyCares Ur creative team sucks if no one ever brought that up. I’m not helping you I’m switching platforms after this month.
@SpotifyCares Hi hello Spotify cares mine is still pausing and playing as well as changing songs
@SpotifyCares Nothing will get deleted or have to change will it? (Just curious)
@SpotifyCares 'This song is not available. If you have the file on your computer you can import it.' applies to tracks by Kendrick Lamar.
@SpotifyCares Right now, no songs can play on the web player
@SpotifyCares it worked! thanks!
@SpotifyCares USA
@SpotifyCares it's playing "And One", also from @9404 but, that song is from the Hybrid Theory EP: https://t.co/e6NdUw9J3C
@SpotifyCares here it goes https://t.co/KZRC8Ztzsw
@SpotifyCares done!
@SpotifyCares Ideally I would like to keep my profile and all my playlists
@SpotifyCares …when some authoritative forum posts say eXACt opposite.
@SpotifyCares No gift card (physical or E). I couldn’t complete a purchase &amp; eventually I realized eVERy avenue was closed. Even VPN + PayPal eGift.
@SpotifyCares All songs synced offline, it's happened like three times now
@SpotifyCares Yes! Every time I have my phone on shuffle I get about 30 songs in a row that is purely two artists! No matter how many times I reshuffle
@SpotifyCares Your support team is slower than your programming monkeys - it was fixed by the time you responded.
@SpotifyCares Ok, turned out got IPV6 address from my ISP, asked them to assign IPV4, now it works fine again. Sorry for bothering :)
@SpotifyCares you sent a while back to verify the email it appears it's now registered to another email address? (2/2)
@SpotifyCares Fourteen Gears by Midland, I saw it was on at one point or another. It’d be really big for Spotifty to have it again because no other music app does! 😉
@SpotifyCares I log in to Spotify thru FB, so changed my FB password but it hasn't worked. Any ideas how can I fix this? Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Hope have budget soon to be PRM, for now every coin to promote my songs, so still reggaeton ad among my fav blues 🤔 tks a lot @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares No. It's an album. It would be an absolute excitement to Tyler's big fans if included the album some people fell in love with.
@SpotifyCares It was for Jhene Aiko. And the presale code worked! Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Do you realize that for “recently” your link took me to a statement from February 2016?
@SpotifyCares That's fixed it, thanks Sarah ❤️
@SpotifyCares Nevrmind you guys fixed it.
@SpotifyCares You guys are usually spot on, don’t worry.
@SpotifyCares My artist acct is on my Spotify acct that’s stretched to my Facebook but when I try to login via fb, it’s giving me an error message
@SpotifyCares I’m cryin, I love y’all
@SpotifyCares Wait, disregard my last tweet! Bless the lord I get a two-for-one lol, y'all are the realest of MVPs for this deal!!! Thank you so much 🙌🏾🙌🏾
@SpotifyCares @160530 Is it possible to pay a bit more and get the No Commercials plan?
@SpotifyCares its fine now just a little glitch lol
@SpotifyCares I will try that, I think it's got 'stuck' on an audio advert but the ad isn't playing &amp; main play button greyed out so can't even play ad!
@SpotifyCares @26720 macOS Sierra version 10.12.5 and latest version of Spotify, also a member of premium!
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/7PoT0azcFu
@SpotifyCares I got it solved talking to the chat, but now the app won't play radio and keeps popping up loading and saying I don't have premium https://t.co/jtRjVCev2p
@SpotifyCares This seems to have gotten it to work.However I am slightly disappointed in the feature disparity. groove' superior presentation
@SpotifyCares Any word on the Universal App?
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately I can't seem to log in, it keeps logging me in as community https://t.co/PEkM5u42QV
@SpotifyCares There's an album by Incubus (Fungus Amongus) that has one playable track. I can see the rest but not play them. Any idea as to why?
@SpotifyCares When you paste in the link of artists Spotify page and then press the "add" button nothing happens. https://t.co/z4Z1zPWa52
@SpotifyCares yup still nothing
@SpotifyCares thank you 🤞🏼
@SpotifyCares It works! 😀 Now to reinstall a couple thousand songs..😫
@SpotifyCares Strange it's all still on my PC. I can't seem to add the albums back on my phone either. It says 'saved' but doesn't appear in my library.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Will do. 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response!
@SpotifyCares Hey there! From one community manager to another, thanks AR!
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.857 and I dont remember what the ad was but it was in Spanish. Your app smokes Pandora either way.
@SpotifyCares Hi I've got an iPhone 6s running on IOS 10.2.1 I think? Spotify version is 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares It's ok! Alfeo has resolved it for me via chat. TY!
@SpotifyCares This is the version https://t.co/7Gehlu06rT
@SpotifyCares When the software updates it works for a day or so then just reverts back. Just logged in and out and it didn’t help
@SpotifyCares Works when I first update the software
@SpotifyCares it has worked. Thank you very much for your help much appreciated.
@SpotifyCares I would just like to set it to Shaynee
@SpotifyCares i cant seem to find the option to set up a display name?
@SpotifyCares okay thanks for your help, how to you set a display name?
@SpotifyCares That aint good enough.
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks. I’m listening to music most the time and doing something else. Maybe have a Seperate music video playlist and normal playlist?
@SpotifyCares Think it's 8.0
@SpotifyCares Thanks - I'm on a pixel
@SpotifyCares spotify:album:3una8hsRGcDJb5SyclcFz9

The 4th track is a skit which isn't accounted for. The 5th is Where Da At, and it's one off from there
@SpotifyCares My account was downgraded from premium to free even though it was paid for. I can’t use my playlists and so on
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6, Spotify App Version 8.4.20
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/FOj9IgBtBU
@SpotifyCares I set it to Philippines..the problem is when i tap on 'See All' (left photo) it doesn't work
@SpotifyCares Still having problems. Account is still pausing. Somehow someone is still a accessing everything
@SpotifyCares Thanks 🙂
@SpotifyCares I got it! Thank you though. It started working a bit later.
@SpotifyCares No, I haven't experienced this issue on any other devices and I have tried restarting my PC.
@SpotifyCares I am having an issue with my desktop computer. Nothing seems to load.
@SpotifyCares This genuinely just convinced me
@SpotifyCares 10.13 + 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 at home
10.12.6 + (guessing same version as it's up to date) at work
Magic Mouse on both.
@SpotifyCares Clicks don't register if you move the cursor right after
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/7QodZtCbKN
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s plus 64gb
@SpotifyCares Entirely possible
@SpotifyCares MacOS 10.12.6 - view scale is set to "actual size". Here's a pic w/ your twitter feed for scale https://t.co/aBkDRGIVPG
@SpotifyCares Wig thank you!
@SpotifyCares All other music I try from other artists works fine.  Deleted cache, shut off local files, restarted, etc
@SpotifyCares US
@SpotifyCares PC, Win10, 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Will you include December Avenue's Dahan on Spotify? Please do.
@SpotifyCares The adresses are: __email__ &amp; __email__
@SpotifyCares Hey thanks for getting back to me, I'm on about Windows 10 Mobile not Windows Phone. (8.1).  Any plans to make the app work?
@SpotifyCares Your Windows Mobile app is still having issues, any word on getting the app updated?
@SpotifyCares Hey, my account's fine, its the #w10m app that has the issue. I'm not the only one. Want to know if there will be an app update.
@SpotifyCares Thanks but if you read the app reviews on the windows store you will see its the mobile app that has the issue not user accounts. https://t.co/X0HlkjnPjl
@SpotifyCares This will not stand. Remember this day, it's the day you ripped off the wrong person and a class action lawsuit will be filed against you
@SpotifyCares I just figured it out, just have to redownload my music now 🙃.  But thanks for the quick response👍
@SpotifyCares Of course! It's Chrome OS.
@SpotifyCares Just did both of those, and it still doesn't play. It worked fine yesterday.
@SpotifyCares Restarted it twice already and still nothing. Usually that tends to work. I have no other WiFi connections to connect too.
@SpotifyCares Nope, nothing. https://t.co/uDog1IhVeN
@SpotifyCares Everything else works, it's just that the music won't play.
@SpotifyCares I can’t save any new music.
I saw your response to the 1% re: 10k and how it’s not on the roadmap.
I’m not removing stuff from my collection
@SpotifyCares I’ll just use a different service
@SpotifyCares I can’t hit save anymore. I listen to albums.
@SpotifyCares I know you have a limit. And it's stupid. I importanted 10 years of music from Groove. Of course it's more than 10k https://t.co/p6MwVy7as4
@SpotifyCares Both WiFi and cellular. Example of song - Calvin Harris - Feels spotify:album:52LQhrLLYOup9HhaOsv54e
@SpotifyCares the web player isn't working for any song at all.
@SpotifyCares I forgot to delete this. I sent an email, got a response, and replied already but since I have you....iPhone 6S with iOS 10.3.3.
@SpotifyCares But I'm concerned about when? I need specific month and year!! 😡 😕😣🙁
@SpotifyCares Okay but we'd love for you to in India...
@SpotifyCares Launch*
@SpotifyCares That’s okay!! Thank you anyway ☺️
@SpotifyCares Hey do you guys have any info about when Reputation will be released on Aus Spotify? :)
@SpotifyCares Thank you!! Do you know if it will be the 10th or 11th of November in Australia? :)
@SpotifyCares Worked a blast thanks 👍👍👍
@SpotifyCares I'm using Spotify on my Galaxy Note 5 which operates on Android and the version is 
8.4.22.857 which I believe is the latest.
@SpotifyCares windows 10 pro, spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02. it just updated today though (right after i noticed autoplay had been turned back on)
@SpotifyCares after following those steps autoplay remains off. i don't log out of spotify on my main computers, although i restart them often
@SpotifyCares no i turn it off on every device. if it's a bug, as it appears to be, i'd just hope you're aware of it n at least planning on fixing it. thx
@SpotifyCares It’s working again
@SpotifyCares Spotify 8.4.22. It's updated! Android 8.0 Oreo and my phone is a Nexus 5X
@SpotifyCares Logged out/logged back in and restarted the computer, still get the same error message. Restarting my phone didn't do anything either.
@SpotifyCares I tried Wi-Fi and LAN cable on laptop, Wi-Fi and LTE connection on cell.
@SpotifyCares Here you go! No message on the phone, just desktop app. https://t.co/Yqwh5scsjq
@SpotifyCares "aliens! zombies! vampires! dinosaurs!"
@SpotifyCares Thank you! Appreciate the reply #IsThatForMe
@SpotifyCares We are missing to listen Artist's Playlists 😞😞
@SpotifyCares he is in Spotify! just not available in my region yet.....
@SpotifyCares tttthhhhhaaaannnnnkkkk yyyyooouuuuu❤️
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/WRRv56r6gO I've already tried a test account and experience dropouts on that as well.
@SpotifyCares I restarted the router before I shot the video and it had no effect. The dropouts continued as they had before.
@SpotifyCares Yep. No help.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/kicVdbd1gb
@SpotifyCares Germany. Everything runs smoothly on my laptop, but many songs don't play on my phone (they used to, though). I reinstalled the app already.
@SpotifyCares P.S. Android phone.
@SpotifyCares I did it already. Nothing changed.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/7j2qZuAWDW
@SpotifyCares its the app on my mac book pro im using
@SpotifyCares This is not more info, this is your standard line when you deprecate features. Inbox, Apps, Top Tracks in My Network. Like u want us 2 leave
@SpotifyCares Your track record does not lead me to believe you but ok sure
@SpotifyCares spotify:artist:1Cm2q1RxsrfXJssiEz4WX4
@SpotifyCares More than 5000
@SpotifyCares Yeah why? There's more than 10,000 songs that I want saved
@SpotifyCares What if you can’t get an UNIDays account?
@SpotifyCares ah yes i've figured it out 😊 thanks!
@SpotifyCares Seems to have helped - the issue isn't consistent though and sometimes it works fine. I'll let you know if it comes back, thank you for now!
@SpotifyCares Hi guys, this issue has come back :/ any ideas?
@SpotifyCares It's mounted correctly, not sure how I check if it's internal memory though?
@SpotifyCares This is what I see if I follow that and choose SD Card https://t.co/fcp6oJOVYx
@SpotifyCares It wasn't like this before which makes me suspect the SD card - it's a decent one though with a high read/write speed. I'll log out now.
@SpotifyCares Now clicking an artist (even one for whom I've downloaded all songs) gives me the green loading wheel for minutes at a time before loading.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response, but I figured it out. Turned off access to cellular data.
@SpotifyCares google pixel, android and 8.4.22.857 armV7
@SpotifyCares U JUST STOPPED DOING NUS LIKE WYD
@SpotifyCares Both Windows and Android clients are up to date. Spotify songs downloading just fine. Just you don't have this one song. Local one won't go.
@SpotifyCares @115888 cool! Thanks :)
@SpotifyCares I did, please bring this feature back! 😢 it was the most helpful tool for discovering new music
@SpotifyCares Yes, I followed all those steps and some of my songs are there, but the one that I need isn't.
@SpotifyCares 1st screenshot is of my source list (file is in the folder), 2nd is my local files list (Should say VENOM HOC 2017) 3rd is my songs list. https://t.co/K8w3TyFB5T
@SpotifyCares They are both .mp3 files
@SpotifyCares Hi, I already have QuickTime installed on my Mac
@SpotifyCares I reinstalled it and it still isn't working :(
@SpotifyCares Hi, I'm on MacOS High Sierra (Latest version)
@SpotifyCares Hi, it's a Google Pixel, and I'm guessing this is the version? 😭 Thank you ❤️ https://t.co/PJMYbLM3pa
@SpotifyCares moments by one direction is not on Spotify Colombia
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S8, Android 7.0, Spotify Version 8.4.22.857 armV7.
@SpotifyCares Sorry for late reply still doesn't solve problem
@SpotifyCares Thank you 🧀
@SpotifyCares Thanks. It says I should have automatically had the 60 day premium  applied when I transferred my music but I'm still set as a free user?
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/CBYoNgfrUw
@SpotifyCares Oh it's ok ty for responding. I got it taken care of with an agent on the spotify website!
@SpotifyCares Everything else is fine until this one ad comes up. Not sure if you’ll know it but it has pictures or photos being split up and spread out.
@SpotifyCares Everything is fine. I’ve restarted and all. Everything is fine until the one ad shows up. Has nothing to do with anything but that ad.
@SpotifyCares It’s your stupid HP ink cartridges ad that’s doing it! Get rid of it!
@SpotifyCares Windows 7. I5 processor, 4gb ram. Shouldn’t be happening but one of your stupid ads rapes my usage. Latest version of Spotify.
@SpotifyCares I definitely can't wait. 😍 Just recently got into using Spotify after getting my first song up and didn't realise how good it was.
@SpotifyCares It keeps telling me to turn on mobile data to download music, only fix i found online was re download the app ..
@SpotifyCares I do indeed have a Spotify account and I"m logged in! Perhaps I'm blind, but I cannot find the correct 'click pathway' to be able to submit
@SpotifyCares Hi there, I updated my iPhone and when I click on Spotify this message pops up https://t.co/MM0KKOefFU
@SpotifyCares Yes thankyou
@SpotifyCares When I just click the song nothing happens. If try to shuffle play a playlist/album that has songs by them in it...(1/2)
@SpotifyCares I get an error message that says "This song is not available" https://t.co/94OHXGC3sg
@SpotifyCares If a song by one of these artists is queued up or next in a playlist, it will just completely skip over it.
@SpotifyCares Yes I tried on my laptop and they work on there.
@SpotifyCares That's what I did, but much better would be to avoid the situation all together ✌️
@SpotifyCares Useless. If that was the issue, I wouldn't have the need to contact you.
@SpotifyCares It was, and for some reason restart of device was no help. Just cleared cache and tried again, seem to be back in action now. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thanks! 🤘
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares Pixel xl, android' spotify 8.4.22.857?
@SpotifyCares No error message. The app crashes or just pauses
@SpotifyCares LTE and wifi both. I have 71 gb of free space
@SpotifyCares thanks guys. you are the best!
@SpotifyCares @115888 @13582 CC: @319835
@SpotifyCares Bummer
@SpotifyCares I know you can only do what you can do. It's my favorite soundtrack, and I'd love if I could have it as part of my Spotify experience
@SpotifyCares Still an issue on both desktop + mobile. Says "this song is not available"...Most other music streams successfully.
@SpotifyCares Also, now noticing same issue with albums from @40096 + @1966.
@SpotifyCares macOS High Sierra + iOS 11.0.3 (iPhone 6)
@SpotifyCares Does not help. Perhaps you should be troubleshooting your file encoding + ingestion on your end.
@SpotifyCares Confirmed I followed the steps provided for both Mac and iPhone. Result is the same. No love.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/PaJYyOlWvR
@SpotifyCares Thank you! :)
I use the web player, but i'll look on the desktop app whenever i need to find out. That solves it.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, IOS 11.0.2 and version of Spotify is: https://t.co/vNLGnEada0
@SpotifyCares Nope! I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled too
@SpotifyCares I don’t really use it whilst I’m at home, it’s whilst I’m on my way to and from work. Voice control pops up all the time too
@SpotifyCares Thank you for replying!!Can't wait for Spotify to release in India!!🙂
@SpotifyCares It happens in Windows 10, in my Samsung Galaxy and in Mac iOS. Same message "this song is not available".
@SpotifyCares Logging out and back again worked! I had tried the restarting stuff but not that, just feeling silly now xD thanks :)
@SpotifyCares I can’t play Bruno mars, Trey songz or Demi lovato
@SpotifyCares I’ve tried that even uninstalled the app and reinstalled. But thankfully the app is working 100% now so im happy!!!
@SpotifyCares Yup! All three are playing now and I couldn’t be happier! https://t.co/ZuUBEKZiRY
@SpotifyCares Oh thank you! Can't wait!!! ♥️
@SpotifyCares Restarting seems to have fixed the problem. Thanks for checking in though.
@SpotifyCares Well, it looks like this. It shows them available, but I'm getting the message they can't be played. I'm having no other problems otherwise. https://t.co/Bro2sJYrCm
@SpotifyCares yes ive tried that but nothing worked because the playstation account i want to unlink the spotify account from doesnt exist anymore
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/EGzHYLFXDf
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares Just tried on both WiFi and 4G and same problem. Even my downloaded Maroon 5 songs don’t work!
@SpotifyCares Ok deleted on both and reinstalled. It now works on my PC but still not on my phone...
@SpotifyCares Just logged out of both and restarted, still not working.
@SpotifyCares On my phone it just doesn’t play and skips to the next, and on my PC it says ‘song is not available if you have it you can import etc’
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 and most up to date app version 😊
@SpotifyCares reinstall fixed it
@SpotifyCares tried clearing cache
@SpotifyCares Rebooted phone and fixed it!
@SpotifyCares I think it's super weird it's happening only with Queen songs.
@SpotifyCares yes, I did. Queen is still not playing 😔
@SpotifyCares no error messages. it just doesn't play, just like I showed in the video
@SpotifyCares Thanks for following up. Please follow back in order to DM...
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares I’m using the iPhone 6s and the spotify version is 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares It has been workin so far. Thank you. I’ll try the same thing if it happens again
@SpotifyCares Already have reached out to distributors nd labels and most of them aren't willing to change it or put me as a main artist. Not very helpful
@SpotifyCares Thanks for responding. Definitely having my manager look into this!!
@SpotifyCares @321256 This is amazing haha
Can you guys please also help me out merging my two artist pages? I already reached out to the artist service
@SpotifyCares okay... https://t.co/viprnsNw5C
@SpotifyCares It’s been two months now, I’m still waiting :(
@SpotifyCares Nah that doesn't do anything :(
@SpotifyCares That's gonna be 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Hey! I works now. I can listen to Winnerbäck om iPhone/iPad again.
@SpotifyCares Ok. Thank you. It works fine for a friend on mine, but not for me.
@SpotifyCares Nope, still doesn't work after reinstallation. :(
@SpotifyCares No, still not playing it. Works on computer though.
@SpotifyCares Trying to play Winnerbäck on either iPhone or iPad doesnt work. Nothing happens when I click song or shuffle.
@SpotifyCares Sure thing, here it is: https://t.co/XnBOKuaBz9
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares yes thanks spotify. love u
@SpotifyCares Yeah, I understand how it is supposed to work. I have been using Spotify for 10 years. The list was fine untill this week. Something’s not right.
@SpotifyCares iPhone, free, I've never had this problem...
@SpotifyCares I see I have an update for my iPhone, maybe this is the issue...
@SpotifyCares Will do..
@SpotifyCares 😭😭😭
@SpotifyCares Thanks! It’s very buggy, im on IOS free version, it plays one song then stops, then refuses to play from the same album. Same after ad plays
@SpotifyCares It sometimes appears a playback failed message, but not all the time
@SpotifyCares Shuffling one album, plays one sang, ad arrives, then this message occurs and it changes to a complete new mix
@SpotifyCares @321653 bagian celik dibales bagian aku engga spotify aja nyuekin aku ya allah gini bgt lyfe
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks will DM u as soon as I can.
@SpotifyCares @115888 @127972 Thank you!😊Lots of #Roku users really love #Spotify but it's so frustrating that an important feature like playlists is missing atm!😔#RokuUK
@SpotifyCares Is there no way to implement @115888 Connect with @127972, even as an interim gesture of goodwill, so #Roku users don't have to pay!?!🤷
@SpotifyCares That trio of lines has worn pretty thin now!😩This really needs to be a priority when #Roku users must pay for premium to even use the app!🤨😒
@SpotifyCares Thanks, but this same line has been repeated 'ad infinitum' and it's been 6+ months now... @115888 and @127972 need better @75235!😞😒😣
@SpotifyCares Thanks!😊But, that info is from March 2017: many users in #RokuUK &amp; other regions wish to know WHEN #Spotify playlists will return to #Roku?🤷
@SpotifyCares Yes, I have the IPhone 7, 11.0.3. My Spotify version is 8.4.22. Thanks
@SpotifyCares I just tried that, it didn't work.
@SpotifyCares I'm on 4g. I don't have access to wifi right now.
@SpotifyCares I have a samsung s7 edge. I have the newest Spotify update and the same for my phone.
@SpotifyCares It is happening with other artists, sometimes it says "cant play song" I think but mostly I just try to click it and nothing plays. I uninstalled the app and re-downloaded it but that didn't help.
@SpotifyCares Android 7.0 &amp; Spotify 8.4.23.784 armV7
@SpotifyCares No errors, or anything. The TV proceeds as if I did nothing, and the phone starts its own thing. So I'll have two songs playing.
@SpotifyCares Force closing Spotify temporarily fixes the issue, but then it will do it again quickly within the next session.
@SpotifyCares Phone updates everything in the night, with express permission. I'd guess it was around the start of September, though
@SpotifyCares thanks, much appreciated!
@SpotifyCares I just tried it again and it’s working. Thanks for the support.
@SpotifyCares Thanks I am on iOS 11.0.2 and Spotify 8.4.22.515. Everything else works fine. Just an Ed free zone .
@SpotifyCares I have since logged out of all devices and updated my password but I'd like to know where that listening activity came from.
@SpotifyCares Okay, thank you so much, I can not see the time.
@SpotifyCares Here you go... https://t.co/vhYbOQ5xbw
@SpotifyCares Was there first - does not answer either question
@SpotifyCares I don’t want to sort an individual list-I want to sort all lists

List - Rock
List - Alt
List - Hip

Sort 
List - Alt
List - Hip
List - rock
@SpotifyCares nevermind, was able to subscribe to premium after 30 mins
@SpotifyCares yep. thanks!
@SpotifyCares thanks for the quick response!
@SpotifyCares Our artwork has appeared on this profile but not ours https://t.co/iOrKOTb5uR
@SpotifyCares Any update?  This topic is at 3,599 votes....I would probably even pay for the app at this point...
@SpotifyCares Cont: I am using an Android system.
@SpotifyCares I was checking for the address and the problem seems to have solved itself. Sorry for the inconvenience.
@SpotifyCares That helped short term but it reverted back. Is there another setting I should check?
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.3 Spotify 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares Cheers team, it would obviously be a great feature! Keep us in the loop
@SpotifyCares Seems like I can't get Beck to play on my laptop either: Dell Inspiron running Windows 7.
@SpotifyCares No error message, sometimes looks like it’s about to play, I see the song bar for a split second but disappears too quickly for a screenshot
@SpotifyCares &lt;3
@SpotifyCares thank you friend!! :)
@SpotifyCares Pls &amp; Thx
@SpotifyCares @117168 @83481 So I have to go through and manually remove every song?  Fan of the artist, but don’t want this in my specific playlist. #shady
@SpotifyCares No worries they're back, thanks for your help!
@SpotifyCares Excellent! Thank you! MacOS Sierra 10.12.6 and Spotify version 1.0.65.320
@SpotifyCares I will try. Thank you for your kindness today!
@SpotifyCares I have NEW LIFE thanks to you! This seems to have worked!! Very thankful for your popping into my feed!
@SpotifyCares It's been running smoothly today, so far.  It's a desktop, Windows 7, and Chrome browser.
@SpotifyCares Will do.  Thanks!
@SpotifyCares My system operation is IOS and spotify version is 8.4.25
@SpotifyCares Is not about my location? I’m in USA
@SpotifyCares It happens every time I shut off my computer and turn it back on. Just happened again. It saves other settings, but that one reverts
@SpotifyCares I currently am paying for the family plan but the 2 people I have on my account cannot sign in
@SpotifyCares can you tell me the ratio of users that chose this ?
@SpotifyCares what the fuck is "non binary"
@SpotifyCares rather, i meant by "recently added" instead of the onerous alphabetical ordering that's default
@SpotifyCares I use __email__ and my username is 11lrhodes
@SpotifyCares Just wanna listen to kanye
@SpotifyCares No :-(((((
@SpotifyCares Both, also it’s both music I have and haven’t downloaded
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, Spotify version 8.4.22, and iOS 11
@SpotifyCares No it just doesn’t play and stops my music all together, it’s only on kanye West
@SpotifyCares Empty, zero songs. Basshunter no exists on my Spotify. Thank you https://t.co/4Jrk2nOfZ2
@SpotifyCares Thank you, I'll wait for it
@SpotifyCares lmao jk!!!
@SpotifyCares Thanks yeah it comes up with a blue strip that says 'This song is not available. If you have the file on your computer you can import it.'
@SpotifyCares It's a Sony vaio, windows 10, 1.0.65.320
@SpotifyCares Connected to wifi on my laptop yeah, the songs play on my phone but could because they're downloaded from ages ago so already saved.
@SpotifyCares Yes, no problem! iPhone 7+ and the app version is 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares Logging in/out helps for a few minutes with most songs. But once I've played on both desktop &amp; mobile the songs are showing as unavailable.
@SpotifyCares I get the message saying the song is not available and to import it. Such as Underdog by Banks.
@SpotifyCares Hi! I'm running OS Seirra with 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 and iOS 11.0.3 with the latest version of the app. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares triple charged me*
@SpotifyCares Hey, OS is MacOS Sierra 10.12.6. There's no error, I simply click Create Similar Playlist but it's like I'm not even clicking it - it's not like it clicks and doesn't do anything, it might as well be greyed out as nothing happens whatsoever. TY
@SpotifyCares Neither of these worked I'm afraid. I could try a reinstall I guess.
@SpotifyCares Followed all the steps - still no change :(
@SpotifyCares Much like how @116618 smartened up and is making an Apple TV app, you need to take a lesson. Users need to come first … right?
@SpotifyCares I sure would hate to switch to @115948 as I love @SpotifyCares but not being able to control music properly will soon be a deal breaker.
@SpotifyCares thanks!
@SpotifyCares I didn't get any error messages, it just wouldn't actually play. I finally got it to work after the 30-40th refresh and prayer
@SpotifyCares @115888 hello  I am back. I have an account: __email__
@SpotifyCares #SuperSlimey
@SpotifyCares Yeah it is, but why is @135616 getting launched if I only want to use Spotify. I'm calling it a bug.
@SpotifyCares That doesn't make any sense. I tried to open Spotify not both.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares why is something as basic as your web player not working for so many users? this is ridiculous that spotify is not providing any useful help
@SpotifyCares same problem with incognito. what now?
@SpotifyCares if you're "support" then you should already be on top of this issue and have some suggestions for your customers
@SpotifyCares Spotify free. tried on both a PC with Chrome and Macbook with Chrome - same problem on both.
@SpotifyCares Incognito sorted it. Thxs
@SpotifyCares I hear your ads Lima Charlie. 😂😂 Have a good weekend to whoever is behind the keyboard!
@SpotifyCares It’s in the US though
@SpotifyCares It’s ok i found a work around when I didn’t hear back within a few hours.  Thanks anyway
@SpotifyCares Thank You.
@SpotifyCares FYI this is the page that appears on your aggregators link https://t.co/OXMBaBR9H8
@SpotifyCares So if I keep listening to this queue then I'll be in an endless loop of pony songs!!! https://t.co/xc4B0crges
@SpotifyCares What's their link or email?
@SpotifyCares Okay thanks for your help. I'll do that and
@SpotifyCares is the family premium account for £14.99 per month allow you the 30 day free trial like the normal premium one?
@SpotifyCares If we sign up today. When is the money taken out of the registered account?
@SpotifyCares Do you have to pay up front? So if we subscribe today is money taken out today??
@SpotifyCares Yes that does. Thank you
@SpotifyCares And also sorry. I have 2 people who would share one as they don't use it much but can only one of them be logged in at once??
@SpotifyCares It won't let me use that as it says it's not a recognised institution
@SpotifyCares Done! I actually noticed my community profile shows some wrong profile info tho. Any idea why it's not synced with my normal account info?
@SpotifyCares sure! https://t.co/mu2CuFfFGD is the link to the king krule album - tracks 2, 3, 4 are moses sumney for some reason on mine! thank you
@SpotifyCares thank you!
I have a paper due in a few hours.
@SpotifyCares locate my damn album for me before I cry ooo... please?
@SpotifyCares I'm already there in your waiting list...😰
(No delay in good things ✊)
What could be the reason, it's not available in my country ?😰
@SpotifyCares Are there any specifices or updates?
@SpotifyCares The Spotify player is no longer appearing on my lock screen since I downloaded iOS 11.
@SpotifyCares I have to unlock my phone and open the app in order to change a song instead of hitting next on my lock screen..
@SpotifyCares -But shortly after disappeared again.
@SpotifyCares I voted but don't trust you to actually fix it anytime soon. I'm actively investigating migrating to another service.
@SpotifyCares Here's a post from 2 years ago saying you'll consider it in the future. Now it's the future, same lip service paid. https://t.co/kfkLJfVDFg
@SpotifyCares As ridiculous as this may sound I'm hoping that will eventually be lifted/be higher, lol. I'm always finding new music.
@SpotifyCares Yes iam
@SpotifyCares Don't know that either
@SpotifyCares It's still not working! 😭😭 https://t.co/nImAbapA3u
@SpotifyCares Android 7.0
Spotify 8.4.26.770
@SpotifyCares Will do! ☺
@SpotifyCares Still nothing..😪 https://t.co/F5juPQami6
@SpotifyCares Okay
@SpotifyCares Still nothing! 😪😟
@SpotifyCares I haven't tried 🤔 I'm using a S8 if that solves anything? Because I know some things aren't compatible with it yet..
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply. It still doesn't help my Mom, who just wants to play with a streaming kit we got her for Christmas last year (when playlists WORKED). That post is from 8 months ago. No solution yet? I love your service otherwise, work with your customers on this!
@SpotifyCares It should be set to US
@SpotifyCares I'm on iPhone 6, iOS 10.3.3, and Spotify 8.4.28.1104.

This also makes me realize the Spotify version should be copyable in app for instances like this.
@SpotifyCares Yes, airplane mode automatically turns WiFi off in the settings. So in airplane mode on phone, with WiFi off, and in offline mode through the app. I still get this prompt every time I go back into the app.
@SpotifyCares Is there any way to preserve what offline songs and playlists I currently have downloaded on my phone? Not interested in losing 5+GB of songs I currently have synced.
@SpotifyCares Um I'm on mobile but here's the link:
https://t.co/0LzUMmVf6m
@SpotifyCares Many thanks :)
@SpotifyCares ahh thank you :)
@SpotifyCares @16134 So who won?
@SpotifyCares aw JP :( I was proper banging it when driving :(
@SpotifyCares Thanks, hope @256484 will do this, I actually read info pages! 🤓
@SpotifyCares I found it. Thanks though
@SpotifyCares Every single comment on that thread, going back through multiple pages, is saying exactly what I'm saying.
@SpotifyCares It looks like it’s working again now.  If it messes up again I’ll send the info
@SpotifyCares Like I was saying it’s playing music fine, then you click on certain artists’ music &amp; that bottom tab disappears &amp; it won’t play their music https://t.co/QfbbEnKn6S
@SpotifyCares 4G/LTE/multiple WiFi’s
@SpotifyCares No error message, the little bar across the bottom that displays the song just disappears. Issue only on iPhone, tried reinstalling, no help
@SpotifyCares Both. First tried streaming and when that didn’t work tried playing downloaded ones and they didn’t work either. 2 more artists not working
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8, iOS 11.0.3, Spotify version 8.4.22.515.  Thank you!
@SpotifyCares No luck. Same problem and error message :(
@SpotifyCares This is what it tells me https://t.co/ZWlg5Kshcg
@SpotifyCares Woohoo!! Spotify Rocks. 🎸
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s. Newest operating system. Newest version of Spotify.
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.3 and Spotify 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares Yes. I actually upgraded to those versions first. Still an issue. Then reset. Still an issue. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Gotta tell you that your UI sucks. #justsayin
@SpotifyCares I'm using iOS 10.3.3 and newest Spotify version
@SpotifyCares Both
@SpotifyCares No not at all
@SpotifyCares Done.
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much it works now👍💯
@SpotifyCares Messaged.
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the response. No amount data, research, and trends excludes half the population.
@SpotifyCares It was mainly stuff from Post Malone and 21 Savage, neither of which I ever listen to.
@SpotifyCares if it's helpful, i was able to get the songs to play on my amazon echo - but it still won't play through just the device though! https://t.co/RdvRE28S92
@SpotifyCares it works now! :) no idea why!
@SpotifyCares would you guys happen to have any updates on the issue we were discussing in this thread? ☺️
@SpotifyCares so far, its only when i try to play a bruno mars song! ive been able to play other songs. and ive definitely heard bruno on spotify before!
@SpotifyCares on mobile, theres no error, its simply nonresponsive. on desktop, i get this (image attached). https://t.co/VjuALf9rsO
@SpotifyCares just checked - same version for ipad! here's a pic of the version for desktop: https://t.co/HBq9Q0c9ea
@SpotifyCares iphone 7, and here's the version. it is happening on ipad and desktop as well! https://t.co/YUOVPFzNLL
@SpotifyCares I'm on macOs 10.12.5 and Chrome 61.0.3163.100
@SpotifyCares Oh, I'm able to see the artist page when I workaround the search issue. The url that doesn't work for me is: https://t.co/AtActQBIVx
@SpotifyCares songs to a playlist can appear at the top opposed to me having to search through alphabetically / searching.
@SpotifyCares ah sorted, thank you
@SpotifyCares I don't have any other devices. I just have my phone.
@SpotifyCares But my profile pic is a dexter mashup.
@SpotifyCares Yeah, still can't get the page to stop timing out. In pretty irritated. Because I don't have access to my music.
@SpotifyCares It's supposed to he @38267
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Spotify premium, family. Using Windows laptop (Lenovo). v1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02.... should be most recent version.
@SpotifyCares Thanks I’m pretty sure a lot of subscribers who use the same software would like to see this happen 👍
@SpotifyCares I mean, if I got it right: does the artist chose the tag or is it a team of yours that does?
@SpotifyCares hey, thanks for your reply! actually, i'm not having a technical problem, it's just v complicated to get a linked playlist into the app.
@SpotifyCares Some woman pointed out that your logo isnt straight and now my OCD wont let me forget it
@SpotifyCares Do you require any of my account details to do this?
@SpotifyCares Any further forward?
@SpotifyCares No it’s still not working for Metallica
@SpotifyCares Meant to add... I still can’t access Metallica music. Seems to be the only artist this is happening with for me.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, iOS 11.0.3
Thanks
@SpotifyCares Quality reply. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares The suggestion is a real easy one. It's just sorting songs in the library based on how often they are played or skipped.
@SpotifyCares It would help with bulky playlists where I want to add new songs but it gets cluttered with older ones that I don't play as much.
@SpotifyCares Since I play spotify in the car or office a lot, I don't have a lot of attention or time to go through each song, but this would help a lot.
@SpotifyCares That, and a way to view songs previously played without changing the current song.
@SpotifyCares Oh snap, it's not just me then!
@SpotifyCares @115888 regular Samsung 7 and whatever the latest os, I just updated the device within the past week or two.
@SpotifyCares @115888 no, it did not work and I'm in misery for it.
@SpotifyCares -home network/internet connection. I don’t have another network to connect to.
@SpotifyCares Ok, so it’s an acknowledged issue affecting multiple people/accounts? When was the first report? Happy to help with any testing if need be
@SpotifyCares Now all seems to be working...didn't even need to log out or restart clients...weird!
@SpotifyCares -eg MJ, Queen, Rolling Stones, Beyoncé. I’m making a wedding playlist you see but usually listen to lesser known artists. No problem there -
@SpotifyCares All at latest versions. Mac - High Sierra, iOS - no update in App Store on 11.03. Seems to be at account level not software/hardware?
@SpotifyCares Just to add that I've now also tried deleting the recommended cache folders in /Library/ApplicationSupport
@SpotifyCares -my iphone the same songs will not play. I can also "Download" the tracks and still it says the song is unavailable. Any ideas?
@SpotifyCares It was on the messenger
@SpotifyCares So yal really gon try to finesse me to stay 🙄
@SpotifyCares I talked to 2 people and both ain’t know how to help so the subscription canceled
@SpotifyCares nah y’all done
@SpotifyCares That's lovely! Thanks Spotify 💚 https://t.co/nT4jYqJuxq
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/Z3AuTi7oVr
@SpotifyCares someone cares :’)
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/f698l1bIzt
@SpotifyCares You can't even search for playlists
@SpotifyCares Appreciate it❤️❤️
@SpotifyCares I fixen it by sending to a Gmail adress and not Hotmail. Thanks
@SpotifyCares the past three days, when I try to enter the code I received in the mail to get to premium. 2/2
@SpotifyCares I get “invalid username or PW” (I know that it’s right) then when I try to reset it says “CSRF token is invalid”
@SpotifyCares Yep, signed in sitting on the "home" screen of the Spotify app. Roku Sticks.
@SpotifyCares Well they keep themselves updated, but yes forced a check, its up to date.
@SpotifyCares No. And again this was on two different networks with diffrent routers two different roku's it's not the network or the routers.
@SpotifyCares Roku app has no trouble talking to the Roku directly. Same with other apps on the Roku and phone.
@SpotifyCares Found the issue on my own, the roku app is not able to do it.. https://t.co/vzFx9l2YRy also it cant use playlist from account..
@SpotifyCares So yeah, im done with @115888 so many short comings, so much needs to be fixed/polished. Ill stick with @GooglePlayMusic and @129941
@SpotifyCares No, the app simply cant find the roku app, 2 diffrent rokus 2 diffrent networks. This is all it does. https://t.co/mcAsKq5Mv3
@SpotifyCares Nice, will give it a spin https://t.co/NL11JIcuuH
@SpotifyCares Great news, thank you!
@SpotifyCares Latest version (released today) seems to have fixed the issue for me. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Nexus 6p with Android 7.1.2, Spotify 8.4.23.784 armV7, and Chromecast audio FW 1.27.96538. Audio drops randomly after several minutes.
@SpotifyCares Please acknowledge issue and have someone from tech support contact me directly. Thanks, in advance.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/NY4aXgbVMm
@SpotifyCares Iphone 6, IOS 11.0.3 (15A432), Spotify versio 8.4.22.515. no devices
@SpotifyCares After I rebooted the meu cel it unfroze... If it happens again I’ll try to reinstall it
@SpotifyCares All songs from his new album are already available in my country :) And I don't have any trouble playing them now. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for noticing it :) With some time more and more songs are getting available.
@SpotifyCares Hi there just up loaded it all again and still jumps #acdc is not cool skipping #unsubscribedtillfixed
@SpotifyCares Sony Xperia Xz to a Sony Bluetooth speaker https://t.co/a8BZBcnljP
@SpotifyCares (I'm trying to activate the student discount that let's me merge my Spotify Premium and Hulu account for 4.99/month)
@SpotifyCares Just don’t edit music on the playlist? And take that Cardi B shit off of there too while you’re at it.
@SpotifyCares Or make a “RapCaviar for Pussies” and put all the edited music and cardi B on it that you want just kiss me with that shit.
@SpotifyCares and yet this was back in March, here we are 6 months later and still no change #spotify #roku
@SpotifyCares No. It only crashes if I am using premium.
@SpotifyCares Yes.
@SpotifyCares Ah well done clever clogs! It’s all working! Thank you so much! x
@SpotifyCares When I plug it in via usb or connect via Bluetooth it says files not supported. I never used to have any problems only started this week thx
@SpotifyCares Hi it’s version 8.4.22.515 and my car is a fiat 500 lounge thank you!
@SpotifyCares Awesome just did that a bit ago wasnt sure if I was doing it right lol cheers yo also love Spotify been mad using it latly! Shits awesome!
@SpotifyCares Doesn't work on my mobile app either.
@SpotifyCares Mostly no difference; an album released yesterday works but everything else I've tried that's older bar a recent single doesn't! :/
@SpotifyCares Laptop, Windows 8.1, I'm guessing the version is 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02? Got that from the About Spotify thing from the Help dropdown.
@SpotifyCares That seems to have sorted it. Should've done that in the first place. Cheers!
@SpotifyCares Getting that error message again! :( Seems to be just Metallica at the moment out of the few artists and albums I've tried :/
@SpotifyCares No, I'm only using earphones.
@SpotifyCares Happened on both Android &amp; Windows Spotify - newest versions! Only started doing this few days ago and happened around 3 times
@SpotifyCares Nope, just stops my song, connects to webplayer and plays some random stuff. Despacito was the latest one ahaha
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/l2jLOMMBgU
@SpotifyCares The Netherlands
@SpotifyCares Even gives this message for songs that I have downloaded as a local file. Music from other artists plays fine https://t.co/mLrOxl8B5A
@SpotifyCares and I'm considering cancelling my sub. This is starting to get really frustrating.
@SpotifyCares I did that... And now I can't log back in. Says offline n I hit connect and it's just a black screen
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you! Have a wonderful weekend :)
@SpotifyCares Yes I did
@SpotifyCares No it did not.
@SpotifyCares If possible would just like to cancel and get a refund.
@SpotifyCares Please do. I listen to Spotify 90% of the time in my car. It's been a community voted Idea for a few years now: https://t.co/VLVwwT9EG1
@SpotifyCares I've sorted it now they just had to sign up to new accounts with  with a new email address Bit convoluted way to do it but it's done now thx
@SpotifyCares It's not feedback it's telling you your shitty fucking website doesn't work
@SpotifyCares id love you to fix it for everyone and not just waste my time
@SpotifyCares Look at your community forums, you need to fix it for everyone
@SpotifyCares I'm in the UK, and the hot country play list has this alternate display - its definitely better than the normal display! https://t.co/tWcHQSz8ca
@SpotifyCares There you go: https://t.co/25HcN45T2I
@SpotifyCares Haha, thanks, happy to help!
@SpotifyCares Macos, whatever the latest Spotify version is? I’m not sure the exact version; I’m not at the office.
@SpotifyCares No error messages at all; it imported all of them into an iTunes folder, but not full.
@SpotifyCares Sure. Here's a screenshot with the whole Spotify playlist and a fragment of the iTunes one. https://t.co/tyNJHH9LBg
@SpotifyCares It’s all good now, roughly 2 hours after I tweeted u guys it updated :)
@SpotifyCares The podcast option has completely disappeared https://t.co/4LqeHlw3SN
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/q0ZZUAF2pE
@SpotifyCares I will do that. Thank you @116130
@SpotifyCares Just FYI, that came in the form of an email. 👍🏼
@SpotifyCares I'm having withdrawals please help ilysm
@SpotifyCares Aw you're so sweet let's be friends
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 Plus on iOS 11.0.3 and Spotify version 8.4.22.515.
@SpotifyCares Where do I suggest that you get rid of that eyesore of a forum?
@SpotifyCares Done
@SpotifyCares We have, the distro has us correctly entered in the metadata, but the releases stay on the wrong page. Thanks for the response though.
@SpotifyCares I'm on an iPhone 6s running 11.0.3
@SpotifyCares Well I tend to do that often and it never really helped me
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/NIwnid4Dxi
@SpotifyCares When I go to the A$AP Rocky Spotify page and click “shuffle play” it only plays A$AP Ferg songs on the mobile version
@SpotifyCares It’s very possible. Definitely notice it more after the iOS 11 update for iPhone
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares Not to my knowledge. I run my battery to empty pretty often
@SpotifyCares My username is Mia Chaput via Facebook. Only Mia Chaput in the USA!
@SpotifyCares nothing’s wrong im just too poor to keep premium
@SpotifyCares it will play about 2 songs and cut off wont let me press shuffle play again i swipe the app away get the same thing two songs then cuts off
@SpotifyCares iphone5 (ios11) and i have the latest spotify update 8.4.22, i was thinking it was a non premium thing but its never happened before
@SpotifyCares its happened with everything ive listened to on data and wifi for the last week
@SpotifyCares I wish that was that easy. Your support and way of talking local files is really poor and uncomfortable
@SpotifyCares I'll see how it is again later. Thanks for reply.
@SpotifyCares I use free version but video is not playing @ system crashes after 1 song. Happens on iPhone &amp; iPad.
@SpotifyCares It’s stuck at the point where the sponsor’s video plays, but the video won’t load. I now cannot get out of that screen.
@SpotifyCares I only use WiFi for Spotify
@SpotifyCares Same problem when I use 4G
@SpotifyCares Galaxy S7 Android 7.0 Spotify version 8.4.24.871. 

Seems to be whenever I update the app all my downloads are deleted.
@SpotifyCares Oh alright thanks
@SpotifyCares But even my friends have that problem on the iPhone as well
@SpotifyCares Both
@SpotifyCares I have not but I'll try it
@SpotifyCares Dopeee thank u very much
@SpotifyCares Unable to get app to open immediately goes to options wait, exit or send feedback.And Ive installed and uninstalled stleast 5 times
@SpotifyCares Os version says Android 7 and Spotify version 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares I got it to work, thank you!
@SpotifyCares Didnt do anything
@SpotifyCares Im not getting an error message. It just wont play. No matter how long i wait or tap the shuffle button
@SpotifyCares Ios 11.0.2 and spotify version 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares Im on an iphone 6+ btw
@SpotifyCares Thanks, my kid appreciates it. I don't mind on other stuff, just kids and stuff.
@SpotifyCares I enjoy your choice of song! However if you look closely your logo is slightly wonky and it’s really not okay! https://t.co/zLR6DTvpXh
@SpotifyCares I already whacked you out from my iphone. Spotify so malicious dispicable! Kicks out @118721 so disrespectful of @AppleSupport
@SpotifyCares One layer of well-considered UI menus options would make things much easier.
@SpotifyCares OK. Night.
@SpotifyCares New update tomorrow ?
@SpotifyCares No like instead of person A having a different code than person B, everyone has the same code..which can be shared with anyone.
@SpotifyCares I have an iMac

El Capitan Version 10.11.6

Spotify version: 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/Gd3XOtdFjQ
@SpotifyCares Thank you for reply!
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/3FZ51kaRIU

https://t.co/W7yhGx3AMP
@SpotifyCares It doesn't. I've been through this with you guys literally like 12 times and no one can figure it out
@SpotifyCares Well the only time I use offline music is when I'm not in wifi and the only time I'm not in wifi is in my car so I can't really test it out
@SpotifyCares Typically yes. Today everything unsaved except my playlists
@SpotifyCares Also thank you
@SpotifyCares THANK YOU!
@SpotifyCares I'm using it on my desktop, i am on windows 10, and it doesn't say the version.
@SpotifyCares It gave me the error code: 18
@SpotifyCares seems you guys really do not listen or notice
@SpotifyCares "Don't worry"?!? Are you serious? This feature is needed and been asked for years ago, and you haven't responded!
@SpotifyCares K. Thx
@SpotifyCares also, the "Your Music" section, why not let us sort the display order? Alpha up/dn, date added up/dn, Played last up/dn etc?
@SpotifyCares I recently applied for student discount and was wondering if i could migrate student paid content to my non student email spotify account
@SpotifyCares as you can see that post has been up since 2013 and in 4 years we still dont have it? how big portion of spotify users is on iphones?
@SpotifyCares It’s a MacBook Pro - I click the song but it plays a different one
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/0juJKrO6Mf
@SpotifyCares I don’t really want to go through that rigamarole, but I’m sure now that you know you’ll take it into consideration.
@SpotifyCares Price and I’m a student,can I still change to the offer?
@SpotifyCares I’ve dm’d you
@SpotifyCares So there is currently no function to turn off ads with explicit content? I'm thinking that should be a requirement, not an optional feature.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the link! It seems to be missing instructions for the website though?
@SpotifyCares No, I was not able to. The link you sent contains no instructions for how to queue songs on the Spotify web player.
@SpotifyCares I see from https://t.co/raBInZ4fx8 that this feature was removed a while ago. Can you ask the devs to elaborate on why that was done?
@SpotifyCares Is there like a 101 section? I don’t know how to listen to lists vs jus stations or how to make my own stations
@SpotifyCares Thanks so much. 😘😘😘
@SpotifyCares @333054
@SpotifyCares went to check and it's sorted itself out (Y)

@SpotifyCares Yeah all that worked! Cheers for that
@SpotifyCares I mean you guys gave a status update almost a year ago......¯\_(ツ)_/¯ https://t.co/QqjGYQ7R39
@SpotifyCares WOW can clear search now but focus on the real issues like release radars based on follows. Y'all act like we watching porn not on incognito
@SpotifyCares Your move @115888 it's been two months since you "passing on all feedback"
@SpotifyCares Bet you it will be the exact same in 6 months
@SpotifyCares Thank you Spotify I love you
@SpotifyCares hello i want to update spotify payment by mobile but i dont get any code number message what should i do?
@SpotifyCares Hi,
Its happened the past 4/5 times whilst making playlists but if its nothing from your side then must be my side so i will see how it goes
@SpotifyCares It’s happening again. Like every other day I need to do a hard reset
@SpotifyCares I am using an iPhone 7 Plus. iOS 11.0.3 and Spotify version is 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares Yes it works now! Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Hi! In a world Like this!  I have a physical copy.. but.. that's ancient lolol
@SpotifyCares Ah! Understood. I'll just purchase the digital on my phone. Thanks! xx
@SpotifyCares Okay thanks, get it up soon lmfao love that song
@SpotifyCares @333651 Feed 'Em to the Lions - Solo 45

@SpotifyCares Yay thanks so much for letting me know ☺️☺️ I knew you guys would replyyy
@SpotifyCares I downloaded again, but a few hours later, my playlist was gone
@SpotifyCares I'm using my (Oppo A37)phone and the version 8.4.24.871armV7 ?
@SpotifyCares What does that mean really?  Can I get JR Smith's pre game playlist in Canada?  I need to know!!
@SpotifyCares is there a way I can change my username
@SpotifyCares fix tht plz my username is embarrassing
@SpotifyCares Android HTC One X, Android version 6.0, Spotify Version 8.4.24.871
@SpotifyCares We're in! Thank you!
@SpotifyCares I was trying to be funny but thanks..?
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares truly does care 💖💖
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares Interesting. Okay thanks
@SpotifyCares I cam search the songs itself but it doesn't show on new releases
@SpotifyCares Misnamed artists in my discover playlists ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/KqGguesmm9

https://t.co/UZmyMjuvWB

https://t.co/TI9EprUx6T
@SpotifyCares The El-P one is not the same as @15037 and likewise with the Ghostface ones. They seem to have similar names, but are not the same.
@SpotifyCares @15037 Same issue as here 😬

https://t.co/2xReNqIZcM
@SpotifyCares Sent
@SpotifyCares Correct.
@SpotifyCares thank you
@SpotifyCares yes. For sure i know i did.
@SpotifyCares no it has not crashed at all.
@SpotifyCares also sometimes only plays one song and then stops and pauses in between the song. Ive tried updated it twice and still wont work.
@SpotifyCares Nope, it didn't help.
@SpotifyCares I didn't all that. Nothing. All songs play except that one Id like to hear. The other night was Queen, today's issue is with Ed sheeran.
@SpotifyCares I did all that
@SpotifyCares Here is the Screenshot. I pressed shuffle. It happens in all his songs. https://t.co/HwF5UXxPDZ
@SpotifyCares Tried both. Both don't work
@SpotifyCares Most of the music plays, it is just the ones I really want to listen that don't play
@SpotifyCares I have a one plus five running android 7.1.1. But the same thing happens to me when I was using a nexus 6P running android 7.1.2
@SpotifyCares ...I know I’m not a student, I don’t even have a student account. Help!
@SpotifyCares Logged out/in. Tried Chrome,Firefox - same issue, IE not supported. Installed desktop app for Win7 - everything as expected. Webplayer bug.
@SpotifyCares Chrome incognito - same. I can now see ONE album that I saved from the app. Hundred others imported from Groove don't show up, only as songs https://t.co/rq6DtPcsAT
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares Was able to use chat based support to rectify the issue. Completely different experience!
@SpotifyCares I enjoy soft indie pop, or like a smoother kind of music. something I can sing to in the car 😂 Thank you so much
@SpotifyCares thank you so much 😩
@SpotifyCares Hello! How come it’s not exact? You guys go deep on data enough to design an algorithm that can create a playlist just for me 😉
@SpotifyCares Patek Water 🤘🏻
@SpotifyCares It's happened to all my playlists but here's one https://t.co/OSDIkczgLP
@SpotifyCares There seems to be a lot of negative responses to this on the link you provided. Maybe “Spotify” needs to reconsider this feature.
@SpotifyCares I cleared both cache/cookies, tried incognito, and another browser. It asks for login then blank page
@SpotifyCares I'm sorry it's not working. I tried on my phone this time and the same thing happened
@SpotifyCares Tried on my computer and I still get the blank page. I can just go to their help page on the hulu website right it's the same thing?
@SpotifyCares I wish I could but when I click the link I just get taken to a blank page.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/6mcbPFgs7x client build: 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Macbook Pro. :)
@SpotifyCares neither worked :( https://t.co/TVkLFoZuaq
@SpotifyCares nope :( but it's okay, I'll deal. thanks for your help!
@SpotifyCares It doesn’t seem to have done anything. Most artists work, but random bands on discover weekly and new music Friday won’t play either.
@SpotifyCares I’m using windows 10 on a Lenovo laptop—again, some music is working, some isn’t. one band that isn’t is Maroon 5–singles specifically.
@SpotifyCares Page two, signal, twiceCoasterLane:1
@SpotifyCares You guys rock.
@SpotifyCares Welp, I’m just gonna get premium then
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s, version 11.0.3. No error message, the songs are visible but won’t play when I select them. Every other artist is plays fine.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your help!
@SpotifyCares The shuffle button doesn’t work on my iPhone sister. Fix this mess 😤😤
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7plus iOS 11.0.2 and Spotify version 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares The ideal would be a toggle to eliminate seeing edited songs like I imagine exists for eliminating explicit ones.
@SpotifyCares no but apparently it came back up, then false alarm but thanks
@SpotifyCares thank you! pls let me know when you think you have a fix
@SpotifyCares desktop and mobile. but I don't get an error on mobile, it just won't play 😢
@SpotifyCares here you go https://t.co/U1iSvrj2vx
@SpotifyCares it's never happened to me where I can see the tracks but not play them, though. I've seen tracks disappear before (2/2)
@SpotifyCares no, I tried that earlier. I'm hoping they're just sorting out the release of her new album and that's why it's being buggy. (1/2)
@SpotifyCares noooo, I was JUST listening to her stuff 😭thanks for replying tho
@SpotifyCares Yeah after switching to a different album it started working again.
@SpotifyCares Latest Chrome on Mac. The player never works when coming out of sleep mode btw. In this case I had to switch to a dif album to make it work.
@SpotifyCares Why do we have to vote on it? Make our lives easier lmao. Knew I should’ve dropped Spotify a while ago.
@SpotifyCares So there’s nothing I can do to add more. This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever experienced.
@SpotifyCares Awesome! Thanks for the fast response :D
@SpotifyCares Is the price always $4.99 a month or will the price change over time ??
@SpotifyCares never mind, it's 'sound' in general, videos on youtube are doing it too, so it's not you. ;)
@SpotifyCares because a kick drum or bass line imposing a limit that affects the vocal frequencies is horrible to listen to. As a premium user I don't really like paying for a poor level of sound quality. Normalise volume makes it worse, obviously. An EQ is massively needed too https://t.co/Rg2w2BTxPa
@SpotifyCares Thanks! And maybe have a link in the link that asks you to join!
@SpotifyCares It’s iPhone 7, iOS 11.0.3 and Spotify is 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares No, just when I clicked on Spotify I realized that it logged out. It repeats every day
@SpotifyCares Cool will do , thanks
@SpotifyCares My Lana is working again! Thank you!
@SpotifyCares It’s still the same 😢
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much, keep me posted
@SpotifyCares Still no luck, when ever I tap on a song the banner won’t even come up
@SpotifyCares No luck unfortunately, even tried downloading the playlist
@SpotifyCares It’s an IPhone SE, it’s weird as every other artist is playing fine
@SpotifyCares I don't understand why you remove the touch preview when that was the BEST feature in USING spotify. Put it back!! Put it back!!! 😒✅
@SpotifyCares Nine of that applies to me, at least not that i know of. My sd card works with everything else.
@SpotifyCares Im using an android galaxy and its version 8.4.24.871
@SpotifyCares Ok appreciate the response
@SpotifyCares My email had been changed to rifly2@yopmail, and i can't access into my account
@SpotifyCares Thank you! 😌
@SpotifyCares good to know. Thanks for the explanation.
@SpotifyCares I have the app on my laptop and phone. So what shall I do with it if it is no use in Ghana
@SpotifyCares It's ok. I've already chatted with one of your representative earlier
@SpotifyCares Auto play is off and i dont know what to do. Can u please help me?! Already desinstalled tons of times and it doesnt work
@SpotifyCares @219115 It's not working for me either.
@SpotifyCares @219115 Nexus 6P here.
@SpotifyCares I just realized I already had premium on my phone for that one account so it doesn't work. My bad ://
@SpotifyCares I already dm-ed you.
@SpotifyCares I have tried both of those and it still doesn't work
@SpotifyCares No. I downloaded Spotify onto my Dad's PC and it worked fine. I think it's only my PC or my version of Spotify
@SpotifyCares It gave me this error when reinstalling the application https://t.co/DPC5ALbqqh
@SpotifyCares And at that point, I erased every trace of Spotify off of my PC with RevoUninstaller to be extra safe
@SpotifyCares I am running Windows 10 Home Edition with the Spotify version "1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02"
@SpotifyCares Thank you for replying! I am currently in the United Arab Emirates.
@SpotifyCares Aww, that's a shame... Thank you for your help anyway!
@SpotifyCares Spotify ver: 8.4.24.871, device: Oneplus 5, Op system: Oxygen 4.5.13
@SpotifyCares Ah ok thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much!
@SpotifyCares I wanna get this fixed but I don't have time to figure out all of the songs..
@SpotifyCares It's multiple songs in this Mixtape....

@SpotifyCares Tried on WiFi and cellular, same issue. Happens on various devices on same songs. Eg grizzly bear - mourning sound. Fails on all devices
@SpotifyCares It's been happening with various songs, from various bands. Weirdly I just tested a bunch now and they are playing
@SpotifyCares Mac os 10.1.3, &amp; android 7.0. Spotify desktop 1.0.64.399 no issues for years until last 2 days
@SpotifyCares Aweshine!
@SpotifyCares That fixed the problem for a few hours then it returned? I’m using an iPhone 7 with lastest IOS &amp; Spotify update. Any ideas?
@SpotifyCares Still no change. From what I’m reading online IOS 11 &amp; Spotify hate each other. Any ideas on what to try now?
@SpotifyCares Any development on this issue as in seeing its quite common looking about online?
@SpotifyCares We requested it last week, but still no change, is it possible to track a request?
@SpotifyCares Okay. The app shuts down when I try to share a track. Is that a issue that is known? I have a Sony XZ1 and latest updates.
@SpotifyCares Hi! I've been using spotify family but your system do not accept my registered debit card. I've tried many times but negative. :/
@SpotifyCares Doesn’t seem to help it
@SpotifyCares No the app just crashes and I reload it
@SpotifyCares iPhone after a song ends the app crashes

@SpotifyCares The only way is to use a twitter account in the hopes you respond. I can't even cancel this subscription because it's not my account!
@SpotifyCares And of course, no phone number to get this fixed!
@SpotifyCares I've been fraudently charged for Spotify. But I have no account so I can't submit a contact form. And there's zero FAQs to address this.
@SpotifyCares It's awful how your online help is so incredibly limited. It's literally only for users and even they can't talk to anyone on the phone
@SpotifyCares Some albums won't play - it seems entirely random and I've tried on desktop and app, saving as well as downloading. It makes no sense.
@SpotifyCares I'm on a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, Android 7, Spotify version 8.4.22.857 armV7. But like I say, it's happening on (Windows) desktop too
@SpotifyCares Yep it happens on all Metallica songs it come up saying "song not available"
@SpotifyCares Still doesn't work 😭
@SpotifyCares I've even gone to a different place with different internet and it's still not working also tried deleting and reinstalling the app
@SpotifyCares I'mma vote for the filter https://t.co/526oxLuhcB — it's not the topic (I'm a clean dude) but the actual ad that's pathetic. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Most annoyingly, the shuffle function isn’t working. And I’ve just had to reinstall because the app kept deleting saved albums.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s, iOS 11.0.2 https://t.co/bdS11Z1BF4
@SpotifyCares No error message. The shuffle button will highlight green, but doesn’t work and un-highlights when the track is skipped or just changes
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response, it sorted itself out in 45 minutes or so. l
@SpotifyCares It says they already decided not to change it - when it comes to money vs customer satisfaction, money always wins.
@SpotifyCares Guys, don't try to pretend. I know you don't care.
@SpotifyCares &lt;3
@SpotifyCares it fixed its self thanks
@SpotifyCares That is the same contact method as I’ve already done. No one has contacted me back.
@SpotifyCares I have already done that and no one has gotten in touch with me. Like I said, I won't receive emails in the hacked account
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately none of them worked. Any other ideas?
@SpotifyCares Yes just that album. Version is 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares Worked thanks a lot!
@SpotifyCares Thanks! iPhone 5S, 10.2.1 OS and latest Shopify. It's weird it happened yesterday as I was listening to it, something must have bugged
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+, iOS 11.0.3, 8.4.22.515. Restarted phone and that fixed it but started happening again shortly after.
@SpotifyCares No errors, the music still plays. It just won’t show up the player on the lock screen where I can change songs, volume etc.
@SpotifyCares Ok great, if I sing "Saving his life from this warm sausage tea" one more time I may never live it down 😉
Lyrics needed asap, thanks  🤜🤛
@SpotifyCares I went through this process. Not trying to be pushy but I have songs that need to be heard.
@SpotifyCares Did it go through? If not it's Jeremy Ferrick __email__
@SpotifyCares Thank you. That helped for sure
@SpotifyCares Okay thanks 😊
@SpotifyCares Yes its okay
@SpotifyCares Need to reboot about once a day to make it work, not really acceptable user experience wise... Didn't have that problem with Groove!
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/fg2pz0CopB
@SpotifyCares Only their "best of" is available
@SpotifyCares Thanks fam
@SpotifyCares It's nothing to do with the platform of which I'm using, you've not put the correct surname for the artist that I've tagged.
@SpotifyCares Either my mobile (android) or desktop (windows 10). It doesnt respond when i click them, if i try shuffle i get "this song is not available"
@SpotifyCares Not on my mobile at least
@SpotifyCares Windows 10 desktop. No error messages other than the blue notification that "this song is not available"
@SpotifyCares Makes no difference, no. Same songs can't be played. PS - your customer service is really excellent. 🙃
@SpotifyCares Ok great, thanks. I can see some other users (on here) seem to be experiencing the same problem.
@SpotifyCares Yes.  It resets my ad timer and makes me wait again.
@SpotifyCares After 4 minutes for one 30 second commercial I think I'll wait on the reinstall step.
@SpotifyCares I can't log in on my account after I do clear data on my Spotify. My account auliafarefa . Email __email__
@SpotifyCares I did "Forgot Password" but it said Spotify doesn't know my email
@SpotifyCares It looks like that update is almost 2 years old... I didn't page through the next 110 pages of comments, but I've always had issues with it
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I already did. But without increasing this limit, it'll be very hard to use your service. I'm honestly considering cancelling.
@SpotifyCares Samsung Galaxy S8+, Android 7.0, Spotify 8.4.19.792. Today it's loading the app but not updating current song data when the track changes =/
@SpotifyCares Will do; I'll get back to you.
@SpotifyCares It didn't really help.
@SpotifyCares I don't mind doing it here, since I share here; username xaedere. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Ah, of course. Well, that's no problem.
@SpotifyCares Already sent it.
@SpotifyCares Still having problems even after installing the new version, sigh. I DMed you screenshots.
@SpotifyCares @134389 does /DF mean 'DEH FUCK'?
@SpotifyCares I knew hahaha just joking...
@SpotifyCares unfortunately that’s the remix of the *Nick Jonas song... not the original :( Maybe Apple Music has it @115948
@SpotifyCares Hey! The last time I sent you the artist URI link you guys removed the other artist that was being linked to it. Can we do it again? :)
@SpotifyCares It does. Just trying to convince someone up there to raise/remove the limit, even as a paid incentive 👍🏻

Maybe one day ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Thanks again.
@SpotifyCares Maybe that's confusion on my end.

If I save an album of 10 tracks to the Albums under Library does it not count as 11 toward the 10k cap?
@SpotifyCares The 10k limit is the problem, been a problem for years. The other issue I was referring isn't an issue, was that @115948  allows 100k.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/PJWNlMuU88
@SpotifyCares that's a wordy way of saying "no", then?
@SpotifyCares thankyou i live for spotify:)
@SpotifyCares hi! After waiting an jour hour i gave it another try and now it worked!!! You have a new #spotify member!!
@SpotifyCares Spotify - 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
Mac OS - Sierra v 10.12.6 https://t.co/mv1kGG1dBq
@SpotifyCares Have tried reinstalling the app, restarting computer, logging in and out. All to no avail. Reinstalling app worked last time.
@SpotifyCares Y'all are awesome, thank you!
@SpotifyCares It's a Google pixel XL running Android 8.0.0. Spotify version 8.4.22.857.
@SpotifyCares Today is working fine, thx my Operating system is Linux Debian Stretch 9.2
@SpotifyCares Not on a playlist just saved in general
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8 plus on iOS 11.0.3
@SpotifyCares Can you fix the capitalization in these, sweetie? I hope I'm not inconveniencing you too much. Sorry :( Thanks! https://t.co/2PLvoqfCYN
@SpotifyCares I'm using Spotify on a Honor 8 with Android 6.0 and have the latest spotify version installed.
@SpotifyCares Wow, I totally overlooked that button in the upper right corner. Thank you very much for the quick support and excuse my stupidity! 👍
@SpotifyCares No, its just on pc that doesn't work. Reinstalled the app and cleared appdata folder, still not working
@SpotifyCares Windows 8.1 64 bit and spotify 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02, i just downloaded from the website and reinstalled, still doesn't work
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I redownloaded the Spotify app on my phone and it’s working fine now 😊 thanks anyway x
@SpotifyCares Tried that, does not work.
@SpotifyCares I am shocked at you suggesting that to a premium user. How do you suggest getting back songs I have synced over 5 years?
@SpotifyCares Yes and just to be clear, these are songs not on Spotify
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 running on iOS 11 (15A372). Spotify version: 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares The ones I am referring to are local files. The other ones I can just download over wifi, no way to retrieve local files.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for stating the known, there is no way for me to do that. Thanks for deleting all my music with your update. Was a good ride. #byespotify
@SpotifyCares Deleted the app and reinstalled. Seems to run correctly now. Music is flowing!
@SpotifyCares ...kidding? That was the 1st reply in that same thread, no use.
@SpotifyCares ...please can you read the massive amounts of detail I've already provided on the Spotify thread on the link I've provided?
@SpotifyCares Hi! I can't select the US out of those countries..
@SpotifyCares The United States
@SpotifyCares It was hard to guess so idk what went wrong also my email isn't something one can guess. is there a way I can see what they listened?
@SpotifyCares @115888 @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares very annoying to be curating a playlist series and have tracks disappearing without explanation as i'm building through it.. PLEASE EXPLAIN
@SpotifyCares Spotify premium and ASUS laptop
@SpotifyCares I have a problem every time I try to sign up in Spotify the program tell me (oops something wrong)
@SpotifyCares I try to create a new account
@SpotifyCares It only does this on Spotify. Logging out or restarting the device does not help.
@SpotifyCares It happens over 4G, WiFi, and my downloaded playlists.
@SpotifyCares I'm using android. I recently switched to the student disc. a few weeks back but today I was charged full price...why?
@SpotifyCares Appreciate it !
@SpotifyCares Ehhhhh, no problem!! 😄🎶💟
@SpotifyCares Well that was fast! thank you
@SpotifyCares Good to know. Thanks for your help.
@SpotifyCares Thanks anyway.
@SpotifyCares Are you going To pay my roaming costs because of your bad app ?
@SpotifyCares Finaly After 10days you discover that I m on bresilian 4g(not belgian) &amp; erased all my downloaded playlist before 4h by bus without wifi &amp; without notifications! What Is your solution ?!
@SpotifyCares @41900 @344982 That's not fair. Can you tell me which countries it is available in?
@SpotifyCares That's really not all gravy. Baby.
@SpotifyCares 'Remember dis?' https://t.co/NQixaw7KkT
@SpotifyCares Trying to use the the Web browser version on desktop
@SpotifyCares No, just nothing happens when clicking play.
@SpotifyCares It's a somewhat specific issue with updating the Mac UI when using Google Home to play music. Best if I can speak directly to an engineer.
@SpotifyCares thanks. i resolved by restarting the application. btw the device is a MacBook Pro, OSX, and Spotify version is 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02...
@SpotifyCares I basically just want to start from scratch, remove all my followers and my tastes etc.. I'm on a family subscription
@SpotifyCares I have DM’d as well
@SpotifyCares Aw man I used to love that feature 😔 thanks tho
@SpotifyCares attaching screenshot https://t.co/oYdy2TFNkh
@SpotifyCares as I can't DM u and it's not super secret: akrylamid
@SpotifyCares So if I keep saving music I like it will play those until it runs out of music then it will play suggested songs?
@SpotifyCares I appreciate your responses that you.
@SpotifyCares Thank you*
@SpotifyCares Well currently it just doesn't recognize Spotify as music, like even when I swipe up on my locked iPhone I can't pause or skip music.
@SpotifyCares iOS Version: 11.0.3 &amp; Spotify Version: 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares tried it, didn’t work :/
@SpotifyCares didn’t work either :(
@SpotifyCares 3/4 options are flagged as "Not available at the moment" even thoguh i have prrmium accoujt (OnePlus 3t / android 7)
@SpotifyCares I dont have a receipt. Its in the package with my mobile contract
@SpotifyCares (Safeguard)
@SpotifyCares The last Win10 and Spotify updates were not very recent I think, but I'm not totally sure.
@SpotifyCares I have just done so; if it happens again I'll tell you. It has happened quite regularly over many versions of Spotify though.
@SpotifyCares It just happened again.
@SpotifyCares Spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02; Windows 10 version 1703, build 15063.674 .
@SpotifyCares Not sure how this is supposed to help me, this is the marketing page for the Student subscription. SheerID is not verifying me as a student
@SpotifyCares Saving albums is essentially just making an easily accessible list of them so why is there even a limit in the first place
@SpotifyCares I have a Galaxy s8 and Windows 10 on my desktop.
@SpotifyCares This is all that comes up on the desktop version, but on the mobile version I get no error messages. 
https://t.co/RoN8o1BzO2
@SpotifyCares Just the OEM system maintenance.
@SpotifyCares Spotify App 8.4.24.871 updated 19 okt. 2017.
Android 7.0 on Galaxy S8.
I don't use it daily, but when I do it always prompts for login dets.
@SpotifyCares Hi, its __email__, but i have recently removed other 2 devices which are the same devices
@SpotifyCares Hi! Just started working again PHEWF. Thanks for your speedy response!
@SpotifyCares yes it's called minxtape it just came out
@SpotifyCares it's on soundcloud and twt
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares this happens with wifi and without, i have 4G and ever since I updated it started not working. also i have a galaxy s6.
@SpotifyCares Nope. Whenever I play an album or playlist it only plays 2-4 songs &amp; then it stops working. I try going onto another song and play shuffle
@SpotifyCares but it doesn't work at all. i tried restarting it but it goes back to being all buggy and it crashes.
@SpotifyCares Thanks bby
@SpotifyCares OS X: 10.12.6, Spotify: 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares seems to of fixed it! thank you https://t.co/ABR0vPv9rD
@SpotifyCares haha. It's back! 😞 https://t.co/TIpjJvJMbV
@SpotifyCares this happened when I turned on high quality streaming?? https://t.co/HbSH5l7SLC
@SpotifyCares Actually, figured it out! Thank you for the reply
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/s55fw0KL9u
@SpotifyCares Just finished a fresh install and still nothing. https://t.co/peheOShERg
@SpotifyCares Updating now to IOS 11.0.3. 
I have the same issue on a samsung galaxy amp prime, same spotify account. Version 8.4.24.871 Andr 6.0.1 thanks
@SpotifyCares Cheers TB, please do!
@SpotifyCares Need some help please
@SpotifyCares IPhone 5s on iOS 11 beta 2. I am currently running Spotify version 8.4.22.515 thanks you
@SpotifyCares Thanks fixed it!
@SpotifyCares You're a legend. Worked with Chrome bad with Safari
@SpotifyCares All tracks, it starts normal then fades into that. Im using OSX El Capitan. I am using the online web player
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares No just when i start THE playlist on my phone or xbox
@SpotifyCares Is this a new post?
@SpotifyCares So you want members who are irritated by Spotify ads to give you our information for free?
@SpotifyCares Anyone available to assist?
@SpotifyCares Great. So now the official way is to create a “downloads” playlist and download that playlist? That sounds hacky af.
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately i havent been able to reset my password and re access my account . Any advice on what to do next ?
@SpotifyCares By the way, if you're really passing on stuff to the relevant folks: I recently had an issue with my account which points to a serious (1/2)
@SpotifyCares glitch on either a) database level (user libraries), or b) backend level. I couldn't get your customer support rep to escalate it. :-\
@SpotifyCares just check ref:_00DD0pxIW._500571VZeOT:ref

I'm not currently having this issue, but it has occurred twice before, and the conclusion (1/?)
@SpotifyCares that your agent came to (unauthorized access to my account) does not explain why my playlists disappeared from my library, but were (2/?)
@SpotifyCares still retrievable through search. on the playlist page, the playlist was still linked to my account. But everything in my library was gone.
@SpotifyCares It seems like a serious technical hiccup. Each time this issue occurred, I did not have access to my library for about 1 week.
@SpotifyCares I'm a long-time and committed user, and being locked out of my library unpredictably is very painful. Real trustbreaker.
@SpotifyCares To then have support dodge my request to pass the info on to engineering colleagues strongly breaks my trust, since it's a serious issue.
@SpotifyCares I work on a digital product myself. If such an issue were occurring, I myself, as well as my tech team, would really want to be aware of it.
@SpotifyCares LG TV
@SpotifyCares Bit of a contradiction how does removing it improve it, great can't use it wow what an improvement that is here have £9.99 🙄
@SpotifyCares Spotify: 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
MacOS: 10.13
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response 😄 Hope to see you guys over here soon 🙏🏻
@SpotifyCares I got it all figured out! Thanks for the quick response!
@SpotifyCares Even tried reinstalling two or three times
@SpotifyCares No none at all, really strange and really frustrating when you’re on the speaker at a party. Not a premium account if that helps at all
@SpotifyCares Seems to be most of the ones I listened to, specifically Eminem relapse and bugzy malone king of the north and it happens on both
@SpotifyCares every time I try to join the family invitation I get an error message - Oops something went wrong?
@SpotifyCares __email__
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/tNT0OPZ3a1
@SpotifyCares Hey there! I have 16 of 32 gb remaining.
@SpotifyCares I don’t have any playlists downloaded to check that unfortunately.
@SpotifyCares I reviewed the list and had only one offline device which hasn’t been used since 2016. I removed it, but nothing else applies to me :(
@SpotifyCares Hey thank you guys 🙏
@SpotifyCares Thx
@SpotifyCares I received one canned response, but I’m still waiting for a resolution
@SpotifyCares @346945 I need support
@SpotifyCares It's working again. No idea what happened but it's fine now. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Well you’re already in cahoots with Genius so maybe add the ability to search songs via lyrics in the search bar
@SpotifyCares But I have done the reset function and it still hasn’t worked 😢 https://t.co/vU6OHkIurZ
@SpotifyCares ALL OF MY SAVED SONGS
@SpotifyCares I run into this every other day and it's maddening, especially since it used to be so easy.
@SpotifyCares I mean, it's even almost impossible to find a user in the platform anymore. I listen ALL DAY, for years, but cannot engage anything anymore.
@SpotifyCares Awesome! I was looking forward to the show and got a little concerned when @33468 wasn't listed. Glad that'll get fixed
@SpotifyCares done it, and it still won't scrobble.
@SpotifyCares I even tried reinstalling the app. Just checked in the community that there're many with the same problem.
@SpotifyCares it's lenovo, android, and the latest version of spotify.
@SpotifyCares I have an htc one m9 android
@SpotifyCares I have an htc one m9 Android. I've restarted my phone, logged out, uninstalled nothing seems to be helping. it's been about a month.
@SpotifyCares As long as you make money with me.
@SpotifyCares Asap pls
@SpotifyCares Pls reply here or sa dm
@SpotifyCares I'm on a Moto z force and I happens over WiFi and at times on my 4g data
@SpotifyCares and i have to restart the whole app then i press shuffle play it said you need premium to play the music
@SpotifyCares Ok
@SpotifyCares It worked !! Thanks
@SpotifyCares Hey guys! Wanted to let you know it's fixed, thank you for having the best customer support in the business &lt;3
@SpotifyCares If it helps, it's by artist. I can no longer play music by Kendrick Lamar, Macklemore, The Script, The Fray or Ed Sheeran (that I know of)
@SpotifyCares Android 7.1.2 Spotify 8.4.23.784 armV7. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling
@SpotifyCares My phone (Google pixel). Haven't checked my laptop. Like 30% of my songs now seem unplayable
@SpotifyCares I just said I can remember..been thinking of cancelling for while and this has gave me reason to. Bye
@SpotifyCares Hello ?
@SpotifyCares Odd because I didn’t get anymore information I got information about a test account on Tuesday
@SpotifyCares Hi Spotify! I'm using the https://t.co/1LCOmRN4Wp link.
@SpotifyCares Neither of those worked.
@SpotifyCares I recently update the app and run perfect. Thanks @SpotifyCares  to be attent! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
@SpotifyCares Yeah I only have a short house unfortunately
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares my wife has problems to accept the integration to family plan, at the moment I am the holder and she is the invited one.
@SpotifyCares Voted. Thanks for the link. :)
@SpotifyCares Hey I've followed these stepps and still not a result what is the next thing to do ?
@SpotifyCares Even if I try to put in a row of songs, it gives the error can't put it in waiting row. Very weird bug. https://t.co/OzRGko0Y4U
@SpotifyCares Great, I got it, thanks so much ! Love you @115888
@SpotifyCares Is there an official idea for a "no censored content" button?
@SpotifyCares This feels like the opposite of what I'm asking for
@SpotifyCares It’s not any of those things I don’t think but it’s cool! Still love you guys 😊
@SpotifyCares Cheers guys, it’s a Nexus 6p and app 8.4.22.857 armv7
@SpotifyCares I messaged you
@SpotifyCares actually I sent DM to you already and we're talking about the problem.
Thanks for careness :)
@SpotifyCares I am waiting my sister for sending her mail account.
@SpotifyCares Can I ask something? You sent me Thai Contact Center/ Customer Service but there is blank page seem it's out of service. https://t.co/08MMGwkUZC
@SpotifyCares Oh I just saw the link when you gave me. Thanks. But do I need to inform my problems again in that link ?
@SpotifyCares Google Chrome ver 61.0
@SpotifyCares It works fine for a while, but then quits and won't restart. I have tried refreshing the page, logging out &amp; in again, and clearing my cache
@SpotifyCares Check. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares this is what pops up when it happens. now that I think about it this looks like someone has accessed my account :( https://t.co/RcDG9V1jn5
@SpotifyCares the names of the Spotify playlists themselves are fairly weird and so are the usernames of the people who make them. almost spam/bot-like.
@SpotifyCares thanks. this is what the playlist looks like. all the usernames have that pattern. content varies. playlist from earlier was mostly pop. https://t.co/AHYlTrXCKL
@SpotifyCares don't have access to my computer right now, so I haven't been able to reset my password. just happened again, wasn't even using Spotify lol. https://t.co/XY798COXnY
@SpotifyCares closed Spotify and it literally reopened the app and started playing this playlist as I walked out of my room. this is beyond weird. https://t.co/UUUSSt9flF
@SpotifyCares finally reset my password and signed out everywhere. hopefully this stops now.
@SpotifyCares connected to wifi, so it's not like someone's accessing my device over a shared network or anything. I'm not sure how this is happening.
@SpotifyCares my phone without me even being subscribed to them. I'll be in the middle of a song when it happens, too. the last two times I wasn't
@SpotifyCares yeah the three little lines are crooked. look at the grid overlaid on the picture i tweeted
@SpotifyCares No. Just locally on my pc. Pressing the thingy left of the play/pause/nextsong buttons. The shuffle isnt purely random i reckon.
@SpotifyCares Have you...used the app on roku?  Just open it once and you'll get it.
@SpotifyCares Just tell me how to select any of my self made or Spotify made playlists.  It's a joke because you didn't include that in the app.
@SpotifyCares OnePlus Two (A2003) Oxygen OS 3.6.0 Android 6.0.1 Spotify 8.4.23.784 armV7
@SpotifyCares Persisted while it was on but fixed by restarting the app, no biggie.
@SpotifyCares I have already restarted and logged out and it didn't work. The android version is 7.1.1 and the app version is 8.4.22.857.
@SpotifyCares It is the same with 4G and with wifi.
@SpotifyCares Restarting the connection didn't help. I tried it on my laptop and the songs are playing there.
@SpotifyCares Hi, I just updated the app version in my laptop and the songs are not playing there anymore. It says: The song is not available. If you have the file on your computer you can import it. I am paying premium by the way.
@SpotifyCares Not really, I click on a song and it just stays stuck. If I'm playing another song it stops and nothing plays afterwards. https://t.co/9A4bg9w2PX
@SpotifyCares Still launching?
@SpotifyCares k
@SpotifyCares @352401 Do you really care?
@SpotifyCares Done sir!!
@SpotifyCares iPhone I think the most recent version
@SpotifyCares Yeah. Thanks for linking the thread at least, I did add my vote and a comment. I hope it helps even if I doubt it will.
@SpotifyCares proceeded to buy the normal premium for $12.00, so I got charged twice. Is there a way to fix this? Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Never mind I just had to re download it but thank you for replying
@SpotifyCares Now when I open Spotify it blue screens my laptop
@SpotifyCares It is cryoniclake6897
@SpotifyCares United States last I checked
@SpotifyCares Yeah ive logged in on another device and all nu playlists are still gone.
@SpotifyCares The full playlists have gone!
@SpotifyCares That’s a shame 🙁
@SpotifyCares Hello, no it doesn’t! Feel like I’ve tried everything
@SpotifyCares It made no difference
@SpotifyCares days. How long can i have the error message before I lose my premium? (2/2)
@SpotifyCares woah thank you 😊 i didn't expect to get a reply
@SpotifyCares got loads of @43282 live albums and various ones but not heard that one thanks :)
@SpotifyCares Hi! in turkey, im able to pay the half of the premium version price and still use it if im studying in university.been 2 weeks,still waitin
@SpotifyCares Given modern coding techniques, this feature is from the early 80s yet Sptify has not mastered this.

https://t.co/NFXIE6iQNO
@SpotifyCares S8+ android
8 4 22 857 armv7
@SpotifyCares @348222 I’ve been on premium for over a year and this never happened until now.
@SpotifyCares This is what is showing up https://t.co/q2hzXv2sFA
@SpotifyCares Yup! I just restarted it and it worked! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Samsung A3 2017, and I'm using version 8.4.22.857 armV7
@SpotifyCares ???
@SpotifyCares No none at all. In android auto you say okay Google. It activates you say something it says it back and then does it. With Spotify as my...
@SpotifyCares ...streaming service the dots pop up to say it's listening but then vanish with no action taken. Other streaming services work fine.
@SpotifyCares Without it being able to work with voice controls on Android auto it's next to useless to me
@SpotifyCares I've tried clean instal. Ive tried restarting. Nothing works yet.
@SpotifyCares U.S.A
@SpotifyCares How do I know if I’m in an accredited school?
@SpotifyCares Latest update of Spotify and on pixel xl
@SpotifyCares little bit disappointing for those who can’t pay with credit cards only with iTunes/google play cards.
@SpotifyCares Please advise.
@SpotifyCares Just did, but it looks like it was updated last in 2015...prob time to get those developers fired up!
@SpotifyCares This https://t.co/gOG88IQNHj
@SpotifyCares Use to have a DJ party feature where songs played would automatically mix in. iPhone 6 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares Hey  iPhone 6SE -  iOS 11.0.3  Spotify Version 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares I have now, couldn't do it while driving.
@SpotifyCares I haven't tried it in the car yet :)
@SpotifyCares It’s ok I managed to get it to work. Thanks tho!
@SpotifyCares i want to cry????????
@SpotifyCares It's a design thing. It happens every time I try to chromecast. Adding more robust chromecast support would see me use @115888 again.
@SpotifyCares HTC U11. I presume it's the latest Android version
@SpotifyCares Uninstalled and reinstalled app and it's OK now.  It wasn't actually on offline mode when I logged in.
@SpotifyCares No it didn't. Same error. Won't let me sign in  as set to offline mode, but can't take it out of offline mode because won't let me sign in.
@SpotifyCares No those options do not come up... device or sim.. and my sim is mounted and accessible to other apps??
@SpotifyCares Yes sorry I meant SD card
@SpotifyCares Thanks...
@SpotifyCares It's cool, thanks.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/iVWzZbrRqL

Thanks!
@SpotifyCares It’s set up to Canada. And yes please get it back on that songs a banger
@SpotifyCares This https://t.co/nBPLTZTNw7
@SpotifyCares Using an iPhone so don’t think that really applies
@SpotifyCares How can I make sure I am one of them!?
@SpotifyCares I ended up getting it, but it was sent hours after the pre-sale had started....
@SpotifyCares @356133 same here 504 Gateway Time-out
@SpotifyCares 😢
@SpotifyCares lol thanks guys
@SpotifyCares thank you.
@SpotifyCares I am. But I just downloaded Spotify again. How do I prove myself 🙁
@SpotifyCares All songs. I guess it's one thing if it's pulled by an artist, but if a licensing agreement is about to expire, a heads-up would be nice.
@SpotifyCares Very kind of you to get back to me. Thanks for listening! :)
@SpotifyCares Its saying 'It looks like you are using your Facebook credentials' so i log into my facebook to edited it and it still wont let me remove it
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much for the help. Really appreciate it.
@SpotifyCares I don't want my fb to be connected to my Spotify..dont wanna lose my saved songs too. How can I have new acc with my current songs
@SpotifyCares Album: https://t.co/T9tW4LkDXE
Artist:
https://t.co/ztrG6VtUMN
@SpotifyCares The problems seems to be solved. The most strange thing is that I just did the restart on my Mac and it was unsuccessful.
@SpotifyCares The same issue occurs in any device I tried to use.
@SpotifyCares @38888 @115888 @116130 I'm following  New Music Friday and Release Radar ofc, but i'm not following lenka .Pink new album Appears on N-R eventho i don't follow her
@SpotifyCares Tried on my Windows app, where it says 'cannot play this song' for any PJ, then on my Android app it says it's a premium feature. V Odd.
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares running latest versions of both
@SpotifyCares I don't think you have a page for the other IKON, however, the "merch" link on Spotify takes me here: https://t.co/ertLpyFdNc
@SpotifyCares The IKON merch under the K-pop group's is from https://t.co/K18ymh9y8Z No songs are directly listed on Spotify from the linked artist.
@SpotifyCares Thnx
@SpotifyCares My feedback is here. It sucks ass
@SpotifyCares There's no Spotify for India, that's what happening.
@SpotifyCares I did all of the above. The only songs available offline are ones that are ALSO downloaded in playlists, but it didn't used to be this way
@SpotifyCares Can't login please help
@SpotifyCares Nope :/ songs still aren’t playing after I click on them and have them downloaded even
@SpotifyCares Still having problems, can’t play other songs now such as LOYALTY by @17627
@SpotifyCares Nope :/ tried on my Xbox, pc, and iPhone but to no avail
@SpotifyCares No error messages are coming up on mobile, but when looking on pc, it just says that this song isn’t available, and to import it
@SpotifyCares I’m currently using 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares I’m able to pull up the app and start playing music, but then it will freeze mid-song. And I’m on WiFi.
@SpotifyCares Nope! It just freezes then quits. I can’t tell if it’s my phone or the app, but it doesn’t seem to happen with any other app.
@SpotifyCares I’m using my iPhone 6s with iOS 11.0.3 and Spotify version 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares I can't play their songs!! It says they're not available right now.
@SpotifyCares Same thing with @34965 too!
@SpotifyCares Thank you  .. and Hopefully won’t take long
@SpotifyCares I love, chillwave, indietronica, goth rock, new wave, indie garage rock, underground hip hop and bass music, ty :-)
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much!
@SpotifyCares @115888 That said, it would be 🎉 if Spotify could detect the Spotify data on the SD card and offer to use/merge rather than deleting/overwriting it.
@SpotifyCares Even though the data is still there (I checked), @115888 switches to internal memory. When switching back to SD, @115888 deletes the data.
@SpotifyCares The whole story is that my phone sometimes loses contact with SD card. Once recovered, Spotify doesn't recognise the downloads on the SD.
@SpotifyCares Oh come on, it says not right now but everyone wants it, seems like a bad business decision. You might be losing out on business shortly.
@SpotifyCares I should be at an @44456 concert right now and the shuffle option played a very important song of them and it hurt my feelings 1/2
@SpotifyCares @44456 You should take me to an @44456 show if you really wanted to help :( 2/2
@SpotifyCares I'm on 8.4.20.535 (downloaded earlier today on the Belgian store as I wanted to see if reinstalling fixed the issue)
@SpotifyCares That did it, thank you!
@SpotifyCares As it turns out, the controls have disappeared from lock screen again. Surely you're not supposed to reboot your phone every other day? :-)
@SpotifyCares Nothing I’ve noticed so far
@SpotifyCares Both as far as I can tell. Haven’t tried airplane mode yet cause I didn’t see the connection
@SpotifyCares Just tried, doesn’t change anything
@SpotifyCares They don’t work. Next/prev buttons are greyed out and the play button should be a pause button and doesn’t do anything
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much
@SpotifyCares @321347 Seriously replying to tweets from 5 hours ago?
@SpotifyCares nope. half is grey out. cant touch tem. what a nightmare. or all grey or all available. what's this idiotic half way through is???
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much!
@SpotifyCares Waiting to do so
@SpotifyCares No, I am asking Google Home, play song X. Once song is done, no other songs queue up automatically
@SpotifyCares No dices. Tryed that allready
@SpotifyCares Wont work on my imac, either chrome or firefox, wont work on my samsung s7, on wifi or 4g.

Same screen with empty name or picture or logo. https://t.co/imuJ0EYmEl
@SpotifyCares @115888 @117168
@SpotifyCares Its worked!! Took a couple of tries after restarting but it’s working fine now - cheers
@SpotifyCares We changed from Premium to premium for family. But how do we activate it??
@SpotifyCares Oh no it’s no worries, it’s because I’m away in Spain!!!😂 thank you anyway
@SpotifyCares Hi JE yes I have tried all of this several times, also tried form different machines but the stuck ad's till there, play options greyed out.
@SpotifyCares No changes with this link on incognito, I'm afraid. Running on Chrome, but tried Safari &amp; Firefox several times with same results. thanks
@SpotifyCares Yes I confirm. Used macbook pro osX.12.6, mac mini osX.11.6 . Could it be an account problem? I can provide you my logins in DM
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much. I really appreciated a such beautiful playlist. It was so fantastic and kind from you all. Have a nice week 👌👍
@SpotifyCares @361034 What is DM
@SpotifyCares It's weird because I can pay the normal 9,99 subscription with paypal and Ideal, but the 50% student discount one only with credit card
@SpotifyCares Thanks guys!
@SpotifyCares Thank you thank you thank you! For getting this fixed in the latest release. Not being able to share songs from Spotify was painful!
@SpotifyCares i am trying it on my Mac Pro, in safari, but all I see is a white space. No success, and daughters complaining :-(
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8 plus, iOS 11.0.2 , version 8.4.22.515  I tried to uninstall and reinstall already too. All of pink’s music won’t play.
@SpotifyCares Thanks babe
@SpotifyCares No thanks! A lady named Maria N assisted me through Spotify Chat Support.
@SpotifyCares Yeah, it is a real "need". I'm surprised it is not already implemented.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for response. Found out that Spotify not compatible yet, hopefully soon! @137949 https://t.co/PMeKW84ymR
@SpotifyCares I can not create a Radio from my profile Would you help me create it? @125633 @115888 @SpotifyCares @361693
@SpotifyCares alright thank you!
@SpotifyCares Samsung Galaxy phone and my Spotify version is 8.4.22.857 armV7.
@SpotifyCares I have uninstalling &amp; re-installing the app more than once &amp; still having the same problems. I tried turning my phone off &amp; on 2 no avail.
@SpotifyCares It works fine on my tablet. I guess it's just an issue with my phone.
@SpotifyCares It not letting me use my unlimited skips, download my music etc.
@SpotifyCares Ok hang on
@SpotifyCares Seems to work thanks. Cleared my cache that was a bit scary.  Lol. Thanks guys
@SpotifyCares personal - the vamps
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/v46tKM2XaX
@SpotifyCares They really like Latin music
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares I don't have an LG device https://t.co/XJieDt3aoZ
@SpotifyCares help help help I'm so freaked out!!!! This is NOT someone I know and it's not a case of mistaken identity... it's a hacker
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, IOS 11.0.3, Spotify 8.4.20.536
@SpotifyCares Um, thats odd. It used to only play the filtered songs. Also, is it intentional that adding songs to quere removes the filter?
@SpotifyCares It stopped working last year. Also I switched devices since then. Is there any way to only play specific artists out of a playlist?
@SpotifyCares It would be cool if users could use all 10k on one device, since most just use their phones.
@SpotifyCares ios 10.3.2, spotify 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares I was listening to my music and in the middle of a song it logged me out and now I can't log back in ~ I'm not getting any error messages
@SpotifyCares it's working now...!
@SpotifyCares there isn't any way to control the volume of spotify, specifically, at least on android and ios. I know that there used to be.
@SpotifyCares That's not what I asked
@SpotifyCares Tried, no results. The problem is also on my Phone. :(
@SpotifyCares You doll, thanks! 🌟
@SpotifyCares It’s all good now
@SpotifyCares And I even tired on a different WiFi network.
@SpotifyCares @115888 Everything seems to be working again. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares (sorry this took so long) i have version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 running on OS High Sierra
@SpotifyCares it didn’t work 😢
@SpotifyCares its a 13-inch MacBook Pro Retina mid 2014
@SpotifyCares @362963 It did not. Also tried incognito mode and it didn't work.
@SpotifyCares Doesn’t look like you guys are pursuing it. Better call the good people over at Apple Music..
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the energy!
For example, this track: https://t.co/UlcN0UMYgH
@SpotifyCares (Boys). In the desktop app the old version of the song is played
@SpotifyCares My phone is out of battery, but I can show how does it in the desktop app
@SpotifyCares It shows as normal. The fun thing is that if I have the web player and the desktop app open I can alternate between versions on the fly... https://t.co/FhiIt8KvdI
@SpotifyCares ?????
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+, Dear Evan Hansen's playlist (that I have saved) won't play :(
@SpotifyCares It works, thank you!
@SpotifyCares I've done it already. Can't you escalate this?  There are barely no french-canadian schools listed, although all on @115948. @71547
@SpotifyCares Thanks 🙏
@SpotifyCares well, the problem actually got solved, i updated dell stuff and somehow that turned dell audio's "MAXXAUDIO pro" on and it screwed with it?
@SpotifyCares Samsung 7 edge
@SpotifyCares No it did not
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/Q6FcGeawVg
@SpotifyCares And reinstalling it did nothing
@SpotifyCares For spotify or twitter?
@SpotifyCares I'm using an android specifically a Blu vivo xl with android 6.0.
@SpotifyCares Sad, very sad :(
@SpotifyCares Oh, do you know when Holding Out For A Hero or other songs like that should become available again?????
@SpotifyCares So the touch preview is not coming back? 😢 it was a really amazing feature.
@SpotifyCares Both WiFi and 4G. Android 7.1.1. Spotify updated a few days ago. Previously it was working and I was using the offline mode of Spotify.
@SpotifyCares Just restarted. No change.
@SpotifyCares It is a bq Aquaris X Pro. Spotify version 8.4.24.871.
@SpotifyCares Hello, the whole issue I am unable to login.. so can't logout. I have already restarted the device. See thread above.
@SpotifyCares Throwback Thursday, and a couple others.  Still happening today.
@SpotifyCares Also, daniela andrade's summertime sadness, possible?
@SpotifyCares It's ridiculously slow. Sometimes it won't connect to the Internet even when  I'm on wifi. Had no issues before the update!
@SpotifyCares So I did this. The app is a little quicker bt the connection is terrible. Takes ages to load or it doesn't load at all
@SpotifyCares Waiting 😘😍 hope its come https://t.co/sBtAMkTkCQ
@SpotifyCares When I search up a song  and click on it, it plays a different song every time
@SpotifyCares No longer happening. iPhone 7 v8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares Oh well, thanks for at least telling me now...
@SpotifyCares nvm found way to get them back. Still something messed up i got this random swedish playlist on my account lmao https://t.co/3kexLSf7ZQ
@SpotifyCares Ok...
@SpotifyCares And my project is showing up under his profile. I’m afraid that my future releases will as well.
@SpotifyCares Oh, this is 100% user incompetence. You're all great!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for replying we got it sorted out now 😊
@SpotifyCares And more importantly that is the album Last Don. Nothing. I am from Ecuador. Please with your help for your user. Thank you
@SpotifyCares I'm running Windows 10 Home. My Spotify version is whatever is available through the Windows store, fully updated.
@SpotifyCares Each time the screen just freezes, and I restart my computer. Sometimes it works after I restart, but sometimes it freezes again.
@SpotifyCares I haven't gotten any messages after it crashes. Rarely, I get "Spotify is not responding" before it opens.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. What about on Premium?
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I've got it working. It's never seemed to work abroad before. Must be due to the WiFi.
@SpotifyCares @118266 I'm using older version of spotify 8.4.226.770 on Android 4.4.2 and latest version of spotify 8.4.28.875 on Android 7.1.2 please help!
@SpotifyCares Okay thanks
@SpotifyCares Also perfect timing with that tweet, literally arrived the second my plane landed 😂
@SpotifyCares That seems to have fixed it, Thanks AP!! ☺️
@SpotifyCares No sign of Spotify in here at all actually https://t.co/RKXDK74SNm
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!
@SpotifyCares I think it started automatically downloading on Wi-Fi, and continued when I disconnected.
@SpotifyCares This is on a Google Pixel XL, running Android 8.0.0. Spotify version 8.4.22.857 armV7
@SpotifyCares Possibly, it was right after I left my house in the morning, so my phone may have auto-updated it overnight.
@SpotifyCares Yea, that was the first thing I checked, definitely off
@SpotifyCares It seems like my account was reset, now I have my account but lost all my music, family subscription and my username as well. Great job! 👏
@SpotifyCares If I already have a premium account, can I just switch to a Student account?
@SpotifyCares Lethbridge College!
@SpotifyCares Why would that make a diff? It’s not a feat. currently present in profile sett. Just wish it would be there. Some ppl don’t have fb profiles
@SpotifyCares Spotify version I use is 8.4.22.515. With 4G or WiFi connection, just tap on any Queen track and nothing happens
@SpotifyCares ...and I could listen it. So this started happening this week in all my devices.
@SpotifyCares “thrilled to announce that I’ll be working closely with Spotify to bring Snowy to the Apple Watch as part of an official Spotify iOS app” 1
@SpotifyCares 2 https://t.co/a7iLCBTm7n
@SpotifyCares Hello? @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares You haven’t actually answered my question
@SpotifyCares Did you click on the link I tweeted you above? Brb signing up for Apple Music trial.
@SpotifyCares more like spotifydoesntcares
@SpotifyCares Yeah re installing didn’t help either
@SpotifyCares Happens with both Wifi and 4G and restarting didn't help
@SpotifyCares I went online, closed the app and opened and played a song, same exact thing happened as when offline
@SpotifyCares I can’t skip not can I tell what is currently playing
@SpotifyCares This is what shows up when music is playing https://t.co/3l3FyOh0YF
@SpotifyCares Also can't control music with earphones and i've already re started the phone
@SpotifyCares I have attempted to use the “remove headspace” button, but it just takes me to signing up for a student account, any other ideas? https://t.co/UHsyOFqgkZ
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you. I hope you add it soon 😃
@SpotifyCares Yes please launch Spotify in India. 😃 Thank you. You guys are doing a great job!
@SpotifyCares It has been suggested many times in the past few years. At the moment, listening to Spotify though devices like Fire TV is an annoyance
@SpotifyCares im guessing the US?
@SpotifyCares Kung di ko lang kayo mahal di ko kayo pagtiya-tiyagaan.

Ay
Haha
Ok
Bye
@SpotifyCares I'm in Ireland and I'm looking to see @1966 playing Donnybrook Stadium on the 15th/16th on June 2018. Cheers guys!!!😁
@SpotifyCares No sign of an email yet. Don't know how much more of a fan I can be😔
@SpotifyCares Desktop web player on Chrome. Quitting the browser &amp; clearing the cache fixed it. Appreciate the follow up though!
@SpotifyCares Awesome! Thank you so much!
@SpotifyCares Sometimes. It's 50/50 when both devices are on.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!❤️
@SpotifyCares It's happening over both WiFi and 3G/4G. Restarting my device hasn't resolved the issue either. I just tried it and the problem still consists.
@SpotifyCares I'm currently using an iPhone 6 with iOS 10.2.1. I've been on the same OS for a while now, but the problem only started occurring about a week ago.
@SpotifyCares That I understand, takes quite a lot of time. I want to be able to just save the entire playlist. 
Create a save button, when pressed enter a playlist name. Press save &amp; you're done! Super easy :-)
@SpotifyCares Omg thanks! 🙏
@SpotifyCares Absolutely incredible turnaround time on that reply! You truly care about your peeps! Thank you, I’ll look for it to show up down the road
@SpotifyCares when i try to play from my playlists it’ll play one song and then it’ll just disappear and not let me play any other playlists
@SpotifyCares tried this morning :/ also uninstalled then reinstalled
@SpotifyCares K thanks
@SpotifyCares My Release Radar blows. It's mainly rap stuff, which I only listen to occasionally, and I mainly follow experimental electronic music.
@SpotifyCares add a feed of new stuff! it would be way better than a algorithmically based playlist
@SpotifyCares And here we go again. Are you serious? Where do you find such an amount of counties to launch regularly and always skip Russia?
@SpotifyCares I didn't mean to sound mean, I love you thank you so much for giving us a smooth streaming experience day n night
@SpotifyCares I accidentally clicked the button and it undownloaded all of them 😣. A different option that's less easy to accidentally click would be 👌
@SpotifyCares I'd like to suggest a different button for downloading songs. I have 800+ songs in my playlist that I have saved and...
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Love you. That's why I have a family plan instead of a student. You guys listen ♥️
@SpotifyCares I've direct messaged you. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I have sent you a direct message.
@SpotifyCares No worries, thank you very much!
@SpotifyCares Email: __email__ 

Username: sbstnvlnvia
@SpotifyCares I sent a dm
@SpotifyCares I discovered the problem. Thanks for getting back to me.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares seems to be fixed! :D ❤❤❤
@SpotifyCares Samsung galaxy s6 and I didn't want to mess up the numbers so here's screenshots :) https://t.co/F8j2pMXEkl
@SpotifyCares well i've updated the app and it looks like it's getting better. if the problem is back, i'll ask for your help. thank you
@SpotifyCares I’ve sent an online gift card in the past that’s been applicable for a student account? - good to know that £5 has been wasted tho
@SpotifyCares otherwise I would just use the app
@SpotifyCares No specific errors... page loads fine but then freezes. Other tabs run fine both before and after. I can't download the app on the PC @ work
@SpotifyCares It does not. Happens when I try to use IE as well.
@SpotifyCares The United States. Pls give me my song back.
@SpotifyCares I can't click play on any songs after I played my Daily Mixes last week. I am using a desktop computer Windows 7 Professional See screenshot https://t.co/jZm261mUqk
@SpotifyCares I've done that already does not help.
@SpotifyCares I am using Google Chrome Spotify App. I've tried it in Incognito, and no luck.
@SpotifyCares I tried that...and now it's says I need to go online in order to log back in. But I can't go back online without logging in. 😬
@SpotifyCares I'm at work now on my phone. Will try again when I get home to my computer.
@SpotifyCares Thanks!

LG G6 - Android 7.0
Spotify version: 8.4.24.871 arm V7
@SpotifyCares guys come on.... i don't that that option on my app.... thats why i said it sucks lol...
@SpotifyCares pretty poor experience so far i must say.
@SpotifyCares Yeah yeah but I have a Windows phone lol... This whole groove to spoitify thing really starting to piss me off....
@SpotifyCares USA
@SpotifyCares ok cool thanks!
@SpotifyCares Cheers babes
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/Vk2PHrZHXS &lt;== this is secrets official. No idea wth this is ==&gt; https://t.co/bpNThePc3S
@SpotifyCares Sure. Waiting... 🎧❤
@SpotifyCares Sure. Thanks for the reply. 🎧❤
@SpotifyCares @117153 thank you, everything is fine now :)
@SpotifyCares wow thank you
@SpotifyCares thanks for reporting! it's still poor quality a month later...
@SpotifyCares thanks! i'm looking forward to when i can listen to this in the shower to start my day. :D
@SpotifyCares I followed the instructions on the link. My iPhone doesn't give me an option to edit or delete. The only options I'm getting are in the pic.
@SpotifyCares There is no edit option to delete @146177 from my playlist. Is there another way? https://t.co/3TR5y5WKFU
@SpotifyCares @17470 Yet it still dont work properly, my Danish/English list, is filled with 10 Swedish songs :S friend have same issue
@SpotifyCares Will do, thanks
@SpotifyCares it happens when i create a radio playlist from a song, and also in my weekly suggestions [discover weekly etc]
@SpotifyCares unfortunately that's the problem. I've never added anything in a nordic language!
@SpotifyCares Well, let's wait and hope that very soon it will appear in Russia. And thanks for the answer)
@SpotifyCares How can i get ahold of you guys besides social media,  this is pathetic. I wanna speak with someone.
@SpotifyCares I did that earlier in the morning I got no response. This is pissing me off I have to pay $800 because your app corrupted my SD Card.
@SpotifyCares Not an email but an In App notification. That’s a simple programming. Pass the idea to your IT team
@SpotifyCares Nothing changed :(
@SpotifyCares spotify:album:4US3nmuLIKELhVZdBPiKxx

Just checked and my account is set to US as it should be.
@SpotifyCares it's good, I speak by mail with the support of spotify france.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares IPhone, the latest version and I’m rocking free right now since yesterday. I did have premium Is that why it’s messing up? :/
@SpotifyCares Free version. Updated this morning, I think, but still with the same issue. https://t.co/UH4N7RFrhd
@SpotifyCares 2) Suggests maybe that either adds or the menues themselves are the problem. Or maybe it loads multiple instances of the track
@SpotifyCares Trying to update card information but all I get is, "oops, something went wrong." (Super helpful fail message btw 🙄)
@SpotifyCares It seems this issue is widely known and complained about (but never addressed or fixed despite this, sighhh): https://t.co/wVWS4uedMv
@SpotifyCares Ok this is what greets me every morning: can u Spot (pun intended) the difference? ps. last usage-Audible:5 days ago, Spotify: 20 min ago https://t.co/fR8cH5q5od
@SpotifyCares Its 2017, almost 2018.  Youve got a good library, but your competitors offer more functionality. Ive not had 10k songs since Napster.
@SpotifyCares Please explain how increasing the song save limit will decrease the user experience? Thats what Im reading from the website.
@SpotifyCares Free. I am used to the enforced shuffle but pulling songs from outside the album I am trying to listen to is mega frustrating
@SpotifyCares nope, its still the same, every family member (except 1) is just labeled as 'Active' I can't see who is who. I'm trying to remove one of em
@SpotifyCares Yep it’s still the same. Here’s a screenshot for reference https://t.co/UmzmP8j3Na
@SpotifyCares Am using up to date version of Spotify on my Google Pixel phone with EE. It's the only thing I use it on &amp; takes up 75% of my mob memory 😶
@SpotifyCares Thanks, that works!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for reaching out :) Or fixing it quickly :)
@SpotifyCares 8.4.24
@SpotifyCares Have managed to sort now. My friend unlinked my fb account &amp; spotify for me but it did worry me that somebody linked it originally.
@SpotifyCares the app is: difficult to navigate, clunky, doesn’t even sort of mirror spotify for web/mobile/etc., doesn’t give options + my playlists.
@SpotifyCares This is from a Desktop running Windows 10 - with newly updated Spotify desktop app. Username Fusionette.
@SpotifyCares I've removed the old version and reinstalled the Spotify Windows app but it still won't actually play any songs :-/
@SpotifyCares Nope, it doesn't. It's amazingly useless TBH. It gives absolutely no information on what the available functionality is.
@SpotifyCares Haha, thanks. Sorry to act like sour milk spilt on the floor. However, it is the Curation team's fault they forgot to close the refrigerator
@SpotifyCares Hi there. Spotify app is 8.4.22.857 arm7. Android version is 8.0.0 and I'm using a Pixel XL. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares __email__
@SpotifyCares ive talked with Portuguese support and they said you already know there's an issue. I've fixed on the phone by getting the older version
@SpotifyCares You recognize there is an issue right now, at least, or have you fixed it already?
@SpotifyCares When stuff like this happens please put sticky posts everywhere like twitter so people know you know, or just do a roll back on the software
@SpotifyCares Well I haven’t downloaded that many songs and it’s saying I’ve reached my download capacity 🙂
@SpotifyCares I just reinstalled the app and it started working ok for now. If it start acting weird again I'll contact you, thank you!
@SpotifyCares The app keeps crashing after I play a song too. I’m on iPhone 6, ios11 and spotify version 8.4.24, thanks RC
@SpotifyCares all it does is tell me that the song is unavailable, and if i have the file on my computer I can import it
@SpotifyCares does this with every song from Avanged Sevenfold. also i looked on the community site, and seems like i'm not the only one with this issue
@SpotifyCares yes, same message every device/platforme, and i do not have them saved as local files. i'm using the songs from spotify directly
@SpotifyCares It just won’t play for me. Say if I were to chose a different playlist and my playlist I was playing before was working the new one won’t
@SpotifyCares I think so because I listen to my other playlist and it’s completely fine. I just wanna listen to my favorite band
@SpotifyCares Well I’ve reset my device I just don’t know if logging out will make a difference
@SpotifyCares Wait you mean the email I use for the app?
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/2cm9iILtPx
@SpotifyCares Spotify 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
Windows 7 64bit Home Premium
@SpotifyCares That helps to do but the problem seems to come back every couple of days.
@SpotifyCares It helps is the uninstaller doesn't crash. That happens any time I try to uninstall the program. I had to use a third party program.
@SpotifyCares It says you are not planning on doing this so it would be a waste of time, supporting that app would be much more beneficial for you surely
@SpotifyCares A good idea would be to interlink it into the application already so that a specific song plays as a alarm ringtone whenever needed 👍
@SpotifyCares ios 11.0.1 and version 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares I already messaged you guys
@SpotifyCares yaay, the "Discovered on" section is back :) thanks for listening!
@SpotifyCares Oh 😕
@SpotifyCares So, all I have to do is listen to different genres for a week and it will be updated?
@SpotifyCares If I buy Amazon echo in India, would I be able to play Spotify music in that device?
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the help!
@SpotifyCares it would make my dreams come true ❤️ love you lots
@SpotifyCares I can log in using Chrome, I can direct to an album/playlist, however when I try and PLAY music, the button is pressed but nothing happens.
@SpotifyCares Hi team, 0/2 unfortunately.
@SpotifyCares Two issues, basically:
• The album and artist views should clearly indicate whether a song is streamed or sourced from a local file.
@SpotifyCares • Actually watch the folder tree designated as the "local library" for deletions. Currently, it seems impossible to listen to the streamed…
@SpotifyCares …version if you ever had a local MP3 of a song, even if you delete the file. (Because it may have been an ancient old low-quality rip and…
@SpotifyCares the entire reason for listening to it through Spotify was to hear the song in a decent quality.)
@SpotifyCares PC, Windows 10, updated today. https://t.co/nVltMgt7Nh
@SpotifyCares Deactivating "Downloads" or "Music Library" didn't help, and my media folder wasn't listed there anymore.
@SpotifyCares So I tried deleting random files from the user directories in %APPDATA%\Spotify and %LOCALAPPDATA%\Spotify, and that did the trick. 🤷 https://t.co/nwwqNjwKi9
@SpotifyCares Yes, it is.
@SpotifyCares Removing the possibility of using Spotify on my TV is not "improving experience". It's been 3 months since the app was discontinued.
@SpotifyCares Let me do that and I will tweet you again after a bit to test it thru a few songs, thanks guys 👌
@SpotifyCares All is good now, thank you 👌
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the clarification, why did NUS stop?
@SpotifyCares The OS is irrelevant, this is on a browser. Happens systematically when opening web player after several hours since last time.
@SpotifyCares I think it has to do with "remembering" the song that was playing last time
@SpotifyCares Haven't tried. It takes time, need to log in, play something, close browser window, wait a few hours, open web player again.
@SpotifyCares and I usually use only my PC. Try and let me know if you cannot reproduce on Windows or Mac, I'm pretty sure it's not OS-dependent.
@SpotifyCares Did you follow all steps to test, including waiting several hours without logging out?
@SpotifyCares @147836 Spotify. I love you. The finnish rap can stay for now. Terve and yksi, kaksi and kolme on this beautful monday to you C.
@SpotifyCares Renewed to student but on my Spotify account it still says ‘premium’ as account type
@SpotifyCares That did not work. And, One Direction is the only artist that doesn't work
@SpotifyCares @169291 this is post-oreo update, and I've never had this problem before; still trying to troubleshoot the toggling of wifi/lte states and downloads
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I’ll take a look.
@SpotifyCares I just send u a private massage
@SpotifyCares Alex Stone's Hello. is comedy and different from Alex Stone musician. Creating Hello. (Comedy album) playlist makes music playlist instead https://t.co/WiYmdz6Rpz
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/t7vVV74IdH
@SpotifyCares Version 8.4.22.857 armV7 Android Oreo (8.0) on a Pixel.
@SpotifyCares Tried that already. Twice. ;)
@SpotifyCares Yep - tried that. Searching Twitter it seems I'm not the only one with this issue?
@SpotifyCares I did it yesterday
@SpotifyCares It's only works for few days... Then happen again right now... It's start annoying and wasted my data download any song again and again....
@SpotifyCares I would say maybe over 5,000
@SpotifyCares Why is it a 10,000 song limit?
@SpotifyCares Sucks for the 1%
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.857
Samsung Galaxy S5 Android
@SpotifyCares I will give it a go!
@SpotifyCares Seems better now! If I've any further problems I'll let you know. Thanks :)
@SpotifyCares It worked! Now only *most* of my songs were "deleted" (they still occupy memory). Weirdly, only the ones in playlists remain.
@SpotifyCares I'm sorry to have to leave you. Please do call me when you've fixed this issue.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+, iOS 11.0.3, Spotify 8.4.22. I turn shuffle on, then when I go to skip a track, it just turns shuffle off automatically.
@SpotifyCares Didn’t work. I can’t play any John Mayer songs either fwiw.
@SpotifyCares No error messages.
@SpotifyCares @37323 No song listed, no album art. Supposed to have been released yesterday. https://t.co/NXi7mCaA33
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/4C8ppoAf7L
@SpotifyCares Showing up fine on my tablet but still nothing on my phone.
@SpotifyCares Hey JP. Sorry no :( I can’t even click on the playlist now. More pics if it helps? It’s basically the original soundtrack from the concert https://t.co/OHHHy1W1EA
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/chGCZQJye3
@SpotifyCares Please try! It’s been offline now for like 2 months 😫😫😫
@SpotifyCares Nope. As soon as I click share it exits the song and takes me back to the dashboard.
@SpotifyCares Nope still getting the same issue after I reinstalled it.
@SpotifyCares It's Spotify version 8.4.22.851.armv7 Android 8.0.0
@SpotifyCares Mariah is acceptable post-halloween. But she snuck up on me today and it was Monday, I wasn't mentally prepared....y'know
@SpotifyCares Can I get a referral from you? From what I’ve read/heard they mostly focus on referrals.
@SpotifyCares ❤️❤️❤️
@SpotifyCares Do I need to uninstall and reinstall? Already logged out and back in. Kudos on the Hulu partnership for Student accts, it’s lit
@SpotifyCares Great. Yes, I'll do it again and reboot later tonight.
@SpotifyCares I still only see the year. Missing day and month.
@SpotifyCares Oh no? I'm really curious of why and what kind of reasoning there was behind such decision. This is both relevant and useful information.
@SpotifyCares Was this introduced with the latest update? I have to try and find a way to roll back. It's too much of a hassle to have to Google dates.
@SpotifyCares I was also charged twice when it stated that i wasn’t being charged at all https://t.co/hR5w8qxCrF
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares After—however, the playlist is set on shuffle &amp; repeat.
@SpotifyCares I’m not using the free version.
@SpotifyCares Motorola G5+ and Spotify V8.4.22.857 - also Google Home streaming status disappears every so often and I have to reconnect.
@SpotifyCares Also this is my current view. On slight swipe left and it skips back a song :( https://t.co/DEy2SdlRXq
@SpotifyCares You rock! Thanks so much.
@SpotifyCares It doesn’t crash but it plays an ad right directly after it says I’m getting my thirty minutes
@SpotifyCares Yes, I always do. In app I watch the full video
@SpotifyCares Alright thank you!!
@SpotifyCares Aww wow thank you
@SpotifyCares Nope. Have tried all those. Cleared Spotify cache folder. Re-installed Spotify. Only affects desktop - can play via mobile (iOS).
@SpotifyCares Sure thing, here you go
spotify:album:2sguvaXAzKE5mH8FABsWOi
@SpotifyCares Thanks again, folks! As always, I appreciate your responsiveness!
@SpotifyCares Okay, thanks! That's not a setting somewhere, right? It just happens? I just noticed it because it happens on my phone, but not my computer.
@SpotifyCares It’s definitely something that a lot of people are talking about so it’s worth looking into!
@SpotifyCares Thanks guys! I just want you to be the very best!
@SpotifyCares It’s a real shame because it’s making think real hard about joining @115948
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares (2/2)  however I am not able to change the payment country to do so as it says I am not eligible for the discount. Can you help?
@SpotifyCares Currently using an LG G4, with the updated version of Spotify that released on Oct 4. The OS is Android 6.0.
@SpotifyCares The issue has always happened. Most of the time I am on wifi, and it still drains my battery.
@SpotifyCares Yay!!! If you need a tester, pick me
@SpotifyCares THANK YOU ❤️❤️❤️ https://t.co/LEf8Dnthjc
@SpotifyCares solved with your lovely customer care! thanks anyway
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares Tried re-sending invitation but this happens. https://t.co/yWCdsrTO5L

@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s Plus, iOS 11.03 I think, Spotify 8.4.22.515 - have tried deleting app and reinstalling already
@SpotifyCares It's a basic feature that any prominent audio app has.

@SpotifyCares Is it gonna be changed?

@SpotifyCares spotify:track:7iz4bsfPOrK9wzhXkgUfya
@SpotifyCares No it’s still doing the same 😭😭😭
@SpotifyCares @1721 @236757 ugh spotify this is so annoying I’ve been a premium sub for 3 yrs fix this
@SpotifyCares Id say probably around 2500
@SpotifyCares Y'all really are the best, much love 👍
@SpotifyCares Pls help. I cant log in so that i cant cancel my subscription. My email is __email__
@SpotifyCares I need gas money, i dont want another month of premium
@SpotifyCares Yes hi why does the song "I Put a Spell on You" by the cast of the major motion picture soundtrack Hocus Pocus not stream on your service
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares  thanks, but from that it seems like you have looked into it for three years now and still have status "not right now"
@SpotifyCares It worked, thank you!
@SpotifyCares @377162 I've got exactly the same problem. Already DM'd you...
@SpotifyCares @377161 @377162 I have this issue as well!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s Plus , iOS 11.0.2, and Spotify version 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares Hi! It started working again! Thanks tho!
@SpotifyCares All sorted. iOS update didn’t show any saved albums etc only saved playlists. Required a restart to solve issue. Many thanks for the offer.
@SpotifyCares Ughhhhhh. I need it! ☹️
@SpotifyCares Oh man... I understand. @47287 let spotify have all your stuff Queen!!!!!!
@SpotifyCares It’s something Rdio did. And I miss it deeply while scrolling past the Taylor Swift releases.
@SpotifyCares That’s not ‘more info’; it’s exactly what I ref’d in my tweet? Just saying it’s hard to have hi engmt if NO ONE KNOWS ITS A FEATURE. 🤦‍♀️
@SpotifyCares hello, my friend by the name of Kayleigh (iiKayleighii) is having some payment issues but you're not replying back? why?
@SpotifyCares Why not? This is clearly a feature your paying customers want. What happened to customizable radio? Even Pandora’s algorithms figure it out
@SpotifyCares I can’t say it wasn’t in tune. :-) But generally, it’s always good stuff I’ve never heard or interesting covers. It wasnt a complaint at all
@SpotifyCares I’d rather not say, all I know is I haven’t changed my version but now all a sudden.. no discover.
@SpotifyCares Pops up after I click discover https://t.co/845knogB3O
@SpotifyCares Sure thing, much appreciated! Having some phone difficulties too, I plan on updating to most recent version. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares then once the autocomplete results come up, grab the mouse and pick. When it was just the dropdown, you could use arrow keys. Way faster!2/2
@SpotifyCares 2/2 Any way to bypass 30 days free since I already got 30-days free on original account?
@SpotifyCares You don't have specific dates for the launch?I'd like use the app.
@SpotifyCares And it would be such an easy task for a company your size. One man show podcasts do it, so can u. Thx
@SpotifyCares So far I've sent 3 tweets and two DM's - no response.
@SpotifyCares Glad to hear it
@SpotifyCares Come on
@SpotifyCares Two days in a row n I'm still talking to a machine... EXPLAIN it to me coz this drivin me mad
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks, if they can’t remember their email log in as it’s an old email address are they able to change the email of their account?
@SpotifyCares If they already have an account do I have to enter the email address of the account they are registered with?
@SpotifyCares The interface when I lock my screen doesn’t show up half of the time, and the volume buttons don’t work when I lock my phone.
@SpotifyCares Didn’t work!
@SpotifyCares Thanks I thought it would be easy to subscribe yearly instead of monthly. You have a yearly personal subscription but not a family one.
@SpotifyCares The devices being used feature is stopping me from listening, as you can see there is only one device yet the play button is grayed out.
@SpotifyCares No it doesn't unfortunately, happened sometime after a recent update on Android
@SpotifyCares Also didn't help :/
@SpotifyCares The desktop layout is different to the mobile one. Lots of people complaining online that the feature was removed
@SpotifyCares Resolved
@SpotifyCares on my old phone x
@SpotifyCares it's fine, all under control mate.
@SpotifyCares thanks for the followup, problem got solved.
@SpotifyCares there’s no content warning put it on or i’m leaving your app
@SpotifyCares I have exactly 3,639 tracks saved :)
@SpotifyCares Why do you guys set that limit? That's pretty silly to be honest
@SpotifyCares In addition, is there any update on 16-bit or 24-bit FLAC support? I appreciate the quick replies!
@SpotifyCares This is on windows 10 desktop. Also use iOS 11
@SpotifyCares 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔
@SpotifyCares They're actually there now.
@SpotifyCares Did not know you guys had such a forum! Vote placed. Thanks so much
@SpotifyCares Probably more honestly not sure. Is there someway I can see how many I have?
@SpotifyCares Thanks for writing back. DM-ed you
@SpotifyCares #Lossless is a step forward, but I'm looking for #HiRes.
@SpotifyCares Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus
Spotify Version: 8.4.24.871 armV7
@SpotifyCares No error messages. Just when my screen turns off the music will cut off for like a split second then continue then cut off again and again
@SpotifyCares Restarted and seems to be working for now
@SpotifyCares I’m already on the highest quality setting and it’s still lacking :/
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares sorry to bother you again, but i still don’t have access to the song
@SpotifyCares Sorry- can’t vote because I don’t have an account. Will have to spend my money somewhere else. Thanks for the quick response!
@SpotifyCares DM sent
@SpotifyCares windows 10 on PC. im just on the website; dont have the app itself for desktop.
@SpotifyCares nothing worked; last thing that happened before this problem was an ad came up after a song finished and for some reason I couldn't skip the ad by clicking the play button to the next song on the playlist
@SpotifyCares Nope; none of that; different browser didn't work either
@SpotifyCares Just did.
@SpotifyCares check dm please..
@SpotifyCares Please help im waiting help...
@SpotifyCares HEYYY PLEASE IM ON DM LOOK !!! I NEED HELP
@SpotifyCares @17470 i dont want pay you 4 times in a month untill 12 months ! solve it please i need help.

@SpotifyCares Ok thnks
@SpotifyCares really want to sign up for student disc. &amp; my school IS recognized, but still won’t go through?? Thank you for your help!
@SpotifyCares Omg. YESS!! I've wanted that filter for soo long. And I pay every month. I hope it happens ❤ thank you!!
@SpotifyCares Of course i did.  Then another came on after it, and then another one.  I only got 10 mins in before I gave up.  3 30sec ads 😅
@SpotifyCares Nope. It didnt crash.
@SpotifyCares Thank you i already dealt with the problem  thanks😉
@SpotifyCares Thank You !!! 💙💙 love you guys !!
@SpotifyCares IOS 11.0.3 and 8.4.24
@SpotifyCares Sorry but it didn’t work
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares I actually did a quick uninstall and reinstall and the problem was fixed!
@SpotifyCares Hello, I would like to know why the offer is not available in QUEBEC. Thank you
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately not.  I'm on iPhone 7 if that helps.  I only logged out on the phone.  I will try logging out on all platforms next
@SpotifyCares Logging out and power cycling all platforms did not fix it.  PS4 matches iPhone 7, but PC is the only one with correct numbers
@SpotifyCares I love you, stay golden.
@SpotifyCares iphone 6, ios 10, and version 8.4.24
@SpotifyCares That I was charged 3-4 times for the student. Is there a way that can be reversed ?
@SpotifyCares I ended up just buying a regular premium account because after trying again, it said that I already redeemed that offer. It still shows ..
@SpotifyCares ...dent it does not allow me to "choose file" I've tried this 3 times and have now been charged 4.99$ 3 times.
@SpotifyCares Sweet! Thanks guys.
@SpotifyCares Bitch I pay for this shit
@SpotifyCares My vote has been added :D - Would love to see this become a feature! :D
@SpotifyCares Ive sorted it now but thank you anyway
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/OXdjKWhx9X
@SpotifyCares I just did
@SpotifyCares Sure! Will do :)
@SpotifyCares Thank you! 💛
@SpotifyCares please I beg you
@SpotifyCares I hope you'll do it because I'm really fond of this playlist and I'm not the only one here! have a nice day! :)
@SpotifyCares already found a better option. I've no problem with adverts, unless they're Christmas adverts in October.
@SpotifyCares Google Pixel, Android 8.0.0, Spotify Version 8.4.22. 857 armV7
@SpotifyCares Not even able to sign up using my Facebook account!! https://t.co/wbACpHNGtT
@SpotifyCares I updated to iOS 11 and it’s not compatible with Spotify6 😭
@SpotifyCares All good , I managed to get in finally but the issue is I can not sign in with my Facebook app account, I had to manually type it in.
@SpotifyCares @381402 Hi! I sent you a DM @SpotifyCares . Thank you!
@SpotifyCares That’s a shame. Thank you though.
@SpotifyCares It's been consistently getting worse. I added *one* Finnish song to a playlist and since then the # of Finnish band on DW has increased
@SpotifyCares Can you confirm or deny that the "next track" button is used as a signal for my Discover Weekly?
@SpotifyCares But he’s extremely popular and talented... you need to get him back ASAP
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares The year should be 1988 not 1898

@SpotifyCares Even tho someone that lives with me paid for the Familiar Spotify, I can’t get in. I accepted the invitation 8 times but it won’t work.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!
@SpotifyCares When and how will I know if it has been fixed?
@SpotifyCares Can you explain how linking me spotify premium answers my question lol
@SpotifyCares Lol you didn't help me at all u just linked me spotify premium? why would i pay for a service that is flawed?
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/E1W45kiceM
@SpotifyCares I'm using the latest version of Spotify on iOS 11.0.3
@SpotifyCares Alrighty
@SpotifyCares United States
@SpotifyCares Yes! Thanks
@SpotifyCares Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Yeah, it keeps saying my provider is having a bad day
@SpotifyCares ok..i will contact you again if nothing works...thank you!!
@SpotifyCares i would but i don’t think that would fix my problem...i only want to listen to the music on my playlists and nothing else.
@SpotifyCares Plenty of notes with you from several conversations. Search under davobob
@SpotifyCares can i see my status of account? so i dont forget to extend it, because i dont get/pay my premium account from credit card
@SpotifyCares laptop, 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 , i checked, it works on my phone (downloaded their playlist previously on phone but not on laptop)
@SpotifyCares nop no diff, still "This song is not available. If you have the file on your computer you can import it."
@SpotifyCares still not working
@SpotifyCares 👌 Android 7.0 and Spotify version 8.4.24.871, the latest version I think. When I restart the app, the player back to normal https://t.co/Kc7q5KhAdr
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thank you 🌸
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the info, but I knew all this. When I log into my admin page, all the users just say 'Active', with not other details https://t.co/Y0ssOZ20gu
@SpotifyCares On my PC I am using Win10 (1703) - Spotify (on my PC) 1.0.64.403.gb738707f (Windows Store version) - Edge Browser. iPhone 6 iOS 11.0.3
@SpotifyCares I have ... used IE and chrome - also tried on my phone. I have also tried a different Win10 (1706) PC
@SpotifyCares How is that going to help when I have used multiple devices, using multiple OS and browser combinations?
@SpotifyCares That's too bad. Yeah I've seen that with a couple Japanese bands/artists where their page will come up but no music. Hoping it returns! 🙂
@SpotifyCares Nvm I fixed it all good
@SpotifyCares No problem you guys are awesome
@SpotifyCares You don’t send push notifications? What’s the point of following an artist if you don’t notify of a new release? Seems like a core feature…
@SpotifyCares Wow, big time 👎🏻 on this one, folks. What is the point of following an artist then?
@SpotifyCares Thanks for caring! It's fixed.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/c0sQVpXbV0 Not sure if that's what you need, but its "When You Come Back Down" by Nickel Creek. Im an in the US
@SpotifyCares Galaxy note 5, Android, and idk the spotify version. It's the latest app, as I tried uninstalling and redownloading
@SpotifyCares I've done that. And reinstalled it again.
@SpotifyCares Both, and when I'm not connected to either. Like when I'm just playing downloaded music
@SpotifyCares Hopefully!
@SpotifyCares I can’t get local files to work
@SpotifyCares I'm using Android 6.0 and Spotify latest version 8.4.24.871 armV7
@SpotifyCares Thank you 😊
@SpotifyCares Im using android version.
@SpotifyCares Here's my Spotify version, and my android is 7.0 https://t.co/cXE48vqOaj
@SpotifyCares Finally, it's work. Thank you so much.
@SpotifyCares yea i figured as much, can't you negotiate a removal of this limit with the rights holders? spotify's a pretty large corp after all.
@SpotifyCares no problem, thanks for listening!
@SpotifyCares Dm ??
@SpotifyCares We are a lot to think u were . Thanks and have a nice day JS x
@SpotifyCares What brands are u talking about ? 😊
@SpotifyCares @147836 Already signed up.Waiting for it to be launched in India. Can't wait. The collections are too good. Far better than google and apple music .
@SpotifyCares She has an iPhone 6, and my boy has a Samsung Galaxy tab a. Before we got the family acc, they just shared one.
@SpotifyCares Period on any playlist
@SpotifyCares Sorry for the wait, had to update the app for my tablet, and yes its doing the same as my phone
@SpotifyCares Yes daily mixes on the test account worked flawless
@SpotifyCares hey there, the problem seems to have fixed itself this afternoon- not sure what was going on! Thanks for replying all the same
@SpotifyCares Felt good for that thank u
@SpotifyCares OK hope u guys soon launch in India too
@SpotifyCares Yes, please! No new rumors about the HiFi tier since April - I‘m a little worried!
@SpotifyCares I'm using IOS 10.3.3 and spotify version 8.4.18. Please let me know what I can do to rectify this problem.
@SpotifyCares Hi, I've tried this but nothing happens. Problem still persists.
@SpotifyCares On my wifi hotspot on the laptop it doesn't work but on a different wifi network it works. What could be the problem with the hotspot?
@SpotifyCares I've tried the reinstall but the same error appears. This is quite frustrating as I have a premium subscription which I cannot use.
@SpotifyCares Tried restarting the router but still problem persists. Haven't been able to use spotify for 2 weeks now.
@SpotifyCares I tried with Edge and Firefox both private/incognito mode and normal.
Here go the screenshots. https://t.co/NUfG2Y9ejL
@SpotifyCares lol ppl have been asking for this literally for years and you still haven't done it, despite it being done in ios
@SpotifyCares Oh dammit! 😆 Worth The go heh heh :) 🥂
@SpotifyCares This is my current version on a Google Nexus 6p device.Once I push the share button the app breaks and goes back to the home page . https://t.co/uv3ua5BXfw
@SpotifyCares Maybe it's related to the current Android 8.0.0 version of Google phones or a problem with de previous security patch. Plz fix this. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Excellent news.If I find another related bug I'll pastel it here.In the Spotify forums there's dedicated threads for this on Android. Thanks
@SpotifyCares other artists or playlists are working fine, this is the only one im having problems with :(
@SpotifyCares hello, im using macbook pro/os sierra version 10.12.6., i have the latest spotify update, all lcd soundsystem discography is not playing
@SpotifyCares i tried to log out, restart app, even delete app and download new one, but still the same issue :(
@SpotifyCares yes, i same problem on ipad mini and iphone 6 too.
@SpotifyCares Hi, my device is HUAWEI and an android. Earlier it wouldn't let me play the song and shuffles albums from other artists instead and now (c)
@SpotifyCares Oh well, hope it will be our turn this year :) Thank you! You guys are so responsive
@SpotifyCares thanks 😊
@SpotifyCares @386047 put this song on today's top hits playlist
@SpotifyCares Thanks, that seems to have done the trick for the moment!
@SpotifyCares Android smartphone running version 8.4.24.871 of Spotify app. Don't get an error message, but often fails to load anything &amp; phone freezes.
@SpotifyCares Hi! Wow, didn't expect a reply... I have Sony Xperia z3+ on Android version 7.1.1. Tried both WiFi and 4G, no difference. Spotify app ver: https://t.co/lhAJ9wdD11
@SpotifyCares ...it works. 🤦‍♀️ I logged out and back in earlier today but didn't turn off the phone that time. Very embarrassing. Thanks for help.
@SpotifyCares It's already cancelled it. I'm going to try @1124
@SpotifyCares Alright, reinstall didn't help - Uninstall, reboot, Install did help - fixed, #Spotify day 2 - a good start
@SpotifyCares Happens again, I might be able to troubleshoot it but it should just work :( Honestly not in the mood to look into it. Please advise.
@SpotifyCares How do I switch off shuffle? (Windows Phone app)
@SpotifyCares P.S. and how do I even see my queue on the Windows Phone app? Or even get it back after pressing Pause?
@SpotifyCares They were switched off (white not green).
@SpotifyCares I am going to do a controlled experiment &amp; document it properly for you
@SpotifyCares It happens on all my devices (mac, android, alexa) Basically if I shuffle a playlist the queue will have strings of songs by the same artist
@SpotifyCares No I just add songs to playlists and shuffle the playlist.
@SpotifyCares For example, I have 6 songs from one artist in a large playlist. Almost every time I shuffle, those 6 are consecutive
@SpotifyCares The android version is 7.0
@SpotifyCares I'm using an android phone (Galaxy s6) and a Windows laptop. I can't play any needtobreathe song on either one.
@SpotifyCares @125633 email is - __email__
@SpotifyCares can I dm you?
@SpotifyCares Here is the mobile. Desktop is most recent install. https://t.co/bxlMOSv2Ww
@SpotifyCares While I have you. I am also having a lot of trouble playing sonos through the Spotify app. All devices :-/
@SpotifyCares Cool. Will do. It started happening a few weeks ago.
@SpotifyCares Unless you can put me in contact with the product team(s) you can stand down. Cheers though.
@SpotifyCares It's happening via the London Underground.
@SpotifyCares Awesome!
@SpotifyCares Hey! It's been almost a month and still don't have the app in my watch! How is it going? 😜
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I really hope to have it soon! My early running is not the same without your music playlist 😉
@SpotifyCares well that email address in the screenshot is the person who added themselves to my account. Not a clue who it is but alright
@SpotifyCares actually, which link?
@SpotifyCares Also I have a premium account.
@SpotifyCares I had it when it was released and then the 5 new tracks disappeared a day later. I have tried logging out and in. I removed the album
@SpotifyCares Thinking I might be blow to re-download it but I can't find it at all not even by searching for it
@SpotifyCares I know others have been streaming it today so surely it must be there somewhere
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks for replying.  I will definitely keep checking.
@SpotifyCares Well it's a good idea 😉 Thank you 💕
@SpotifyCares Google Home is defaulting to my account, but I’m not at home so I get interrupted :-(
@SpotifyCares Could you also confirm if I've managed to extend by student account for another year please? :)
@SpotifyCares A couple times lately I have searched for a song that used to be on the app, and now it's not there at all. I am using IOS and a PC
@SpotifyCares That's just a few off the top of my head
@SpotifyCares Samsung s8+ is the only device I use spotify on and it does it quite often
@SpotifyCares Will do
@SpotifyCares OK, thanks! But maybe you shoud give the option to choose between the two, till the newest is not stable!
@SpotifyCares Can't this be done using advanced filtering in the search field, within the web player? @48825 what do you think?
@SpotifyCares Okay :) If you need a developer knock here lol
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/MlsEeNAN6T - i have taken it off playlist and added again bur same thing happens eventually
@SpotifyCares Oh I don't think this is what I'm talking about. I mean on the touchbar on a MacBook pro.
@SpotifyCares Hey, I just wanted to let you know that the issue I was reporting in this tweet seems to have been fixed. Great job guys 👍🏼
@SpotifyCares That's great but I'm literally getting mariachi bands as "suggested" in between Niall Horan songs.
@SpotifyCares To fix this, I have to scroll around to unfocus the text field, then tap the text field again and then the keyboard will appear
@SpotifyCares I'm afraid I am unsure when it started, as it's been months. Still a problem using the latest update to Spotify, Google Keyboard, and iOS 11
@SpotifyCares So no fix has been pushed even in the four months that it's been a known bug, and even longer since it's been (possibly) unreported?
@SpotifyCares @389450 I’ve logged out in all devices already hoping this can be resolved.
@SpotifyCares __email__
@SpotifyCares And they said that they’ll fix it asap
@SpotifyCares Also, I have been forced signed out of my account, and can no longer sign in. Account has been compromised, I think.
@SpotifyCares on my account overview, it says that I have premium for students + hulu but when i go to sign into hulu, it gives me different plan options
@SpotifyCares I did. There's a plethora of users having problems with you app in Windows 10 Phone. Check the comments. Thanks you.
@SpotifyCares This! https://t.co/zaRzefIP6o
Got my Spotify account back today. Ugh, those anime stuff are not mine! Thank you, @SpotifyCares https://t.co/9O8ssnWcGw
@SpotifyCares I was tried for couple times to upgrade my account to premium but i didn’t get the pin for confirmation my payment with indosatooredoo.
@SpotifyCares I'm based in Berlin, Germany. I got access to all other content on @35357 's page though. Thx ;)
@SpotifyCares Dis y I pay.
@SpotifyCares I’ll try that now. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares It’s still doing it :( It seems like it does it when my phone is doing something else. I have these songs downloaded to my phone too
@SpotifyCares i’ve noticed it does it when my service switches from 3G to LTE or vice versa. Or if I do anything involving the internet.
@SpotifyCares I’ll check wifi today. It doesn’t happen on anything other than my iPhone. It seems like when I try to use any other apps, it lags/skips.
@SpotifyCares here’s a video https://t.co/GYKjRbIpEy
@SpotifyCares I’ve never really noticed whether it did or not. I do mostly use spotify in my car. I’ll start using it in different ways and see.
@SpotifyCares Problem still persists. I’ve changed bluetooth receivers and everything. Even used Apple Music for a few days and it doesn’t happen there...
@SpotifyCares Ok
@SpotifyCares Both my Macbook and iPhone. I've been getting this for awhile https://t.co/5u2P8Hg9c6
@SpotifyCares I keep getting a "this song is not available" message for just one song in an entire album. That song works for my friends.
@SpotifyCares @287464 sad!
@SpotifyCares It’s iPhone 7 and latest version 8.4.22, thanks
@SpotifyCares I deleted some songs, but I'm sure I'll hit the limit again. I'll send screenshot then. Would be cool to have Spot show me duplicate songs
@SpotifyCares windows 10 desktop app 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 and i just reinstalled it and i am still having the problem
@SpotifyCares it doesnt help
@SpotifyCares not that i know of
@SpotifyCares Pixel.  Android 8.0. Spotify 8.4.22.857 armv7
@SpotifyCares Thanks! It's set to the UK.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/H3WGqj9V5Y
@SpotifyCares wifi. I try playing music directly on the @137949
@SpotifyCares yep, even tried with a different spotify account. same result. that's been going on for a few weeks now
@SpotifyCares hope u bring it back soon fam
@SpotifyCares aaaah i see, thank you so much!!!! also please bring brother act by btob on spotify too!! aching for it! 😭😭
@SpotifyCares Um... In this case, you need to as when I signed up it made my password my public username. Serious security breach and nobody there cares.
@SpotifyCares Is there anyway to avoid suggested tracks without premium?
@SpotifyCares Thank you. My apologies for being rough, it just really messed up my flow
@SpotifyCares That's great to hear.  I look forward to hopefully seeing this in an update sometime soon!
@SpotifyCares Thanks appreciate it love u guys #letsdothisman
@SpotifyCares Thanks I'll check it out.
@SpotifyCares The silence is deafening. https://t.co/vj27gmFFnQ
@SpotifyCares You replied that I need to cancel my account without a refund and then sign up again.

That's horrible business
@SpotifyCares I appreciate that the phone is 3 years old but the app used to work flawlessly. Each version now seems slower/ worse.
@SpotifyCares i never had any problems with older versions of the app.
@SpotifyCares 8.4.17.640.... Apparently 😉 https://t.co/alDUpdvlyt
@SpotifyCares No, restarting doesn't help. Tbh i don't think there is much you can do. It's more that i wanted to provide some feedback​.
@SpotifyCares The songs called Looking for a star (Can't get you out my head) by Xxxtentacion. It's off the album revenge. But y'all took the whole album off...
@SpotifyCares Ok Thanks! Yes, after the album ended the radio kicked in.
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I already got through the process successfully. It's just that there"loading" circle shouldn't be there
@SpotifyCares Need your help with something @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares awesome!!
@SpotifyCares I have enough balance btw. https://t.co/lGeeewPEtq
@SpotifyCares Im not into the offer that you have now that 3months thing. I just wanna make a payment for regular sub. Why have Globe/Smart as a form of payment if i need a debit/credit card?
@SpotifyCares Thanks. iPhone 8 - iOS 11.0.3 - not sure what app version
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.515. I discovered it was there, got excited by what was on it, and 10 min later when I went to press play it was gone.
@SpotifyCares Aww Spotify really does care. My playlist is back. Thank you again!
@SpotifyCares Ok, thankyou for the response :)
@SpotifyCares Sorry, for some reason the 1st part of your reply didn't show up, i get it now.
@SpotifyCares Or pictures disappear. Very frustrating!!
@SpotifyCares We don't have unlimited data thanks to the big 3 @10693 @15093 @42.
@SpotifyCares Yes.
@SpotifyCares 8.4.23.784arm V7, my device management is the only cache clearing i can think of and it doesn't coincide with when i've lost my downloads.
@SpotifyCares It's random, and when it happens there's no rhyme or reason as which tracks go missing, it could be whole album for some and 5or6 on others
@SpotifyCares What's the alternative now ? Mint ?
@SpotifyCares when I click a second time I get the full-screen artwork, a third click takes me back out of my original full-screen. Weirdness. :) (2/2)
@SpotifyCares Yep, seems to have fixed it. Ta!
@SpotifyCares Dim problem. Nice try at a cute reply, but... https://t.co/JjYlUuUnwe
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/mTKWZpTyPL
UK I guess
@SpotifyCares My command center fails to recognize Spotify so I can’t control it outside of the app. I’m on iOS 11.0.3 and Spotify 8.4.24 on an iPhone 7.
@SpotifyCares it’s like spotify isnt being recognized as a music source anymore.
@SpotifyCares Across my devices, HTC One M10, Toshiba laptop + Xbox One. Sometimes says some1 else is using my account, or its con to another peripheral
@SpotifyCares Hi, I think I’ve sorted it myself but I’ll make sure to let you know if it happens again cx
@SpotifyCares V 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02. Screenshot attached, probably not much use though... https://t.co/87qVYXFjgC
@SpotifyCares Restarting doesn't do anything, and I'm connected to a home network.
@SpotifyCares I'd estimate maybe a week or so? The router has been restarted in that time but it still happens. :(
@SpotifyCares After any Windows update we need to reset the audio playback or Spotify won’t play.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Windows 10 Pro version 1703. Spotify 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares username: bknight2126 email address: __email__
@SpotifyCares It seems unrelated to network (wifi or mobile data).
@SpotifyCares Thanks, AU. That seems to improve performance indeed. I will repeat these steps whenever happening again. If happening a lot, I'll contact you again.
@SpotifyCares @393336 PLEASE HELP ME!ON DM!
@SpotifyCares Ok, so my choices are to go with a third party app not approved by Spotify or give Apple Music my $$...🤔
@SpotifyCares No worries. Just taking a jab at my least favorite band. You gus rock! \m/
@SpotifyCares I used the wrong email when I signed up for the student subscription I was charged in my card but it says I'm still on free account
@SpotifyCares Intel Xeon CPU, Windows 7 Enterprise, Spotify 1.0.66.478.g1296534d (not sure where I check version)
@SpotifyCares Nope - nothing helps. I reinstalled and it worked briefly, but no longer.
@SpotifyCares Work, non-public hard line
@SpotifyCares Happy to do this faster off Twitter too - knittelf(at)https://t.co/h2mmwrcQpE
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/MZ16qJiHeq
@SpotifyCares i linked spotify as a service on my sonos play:1
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you. It’s just frustrating I keep hitting capacity and I don’t even think I have that many albums saved.
@SpotifyCares A default message is so reassuring...
@SpotifyCares Is this just a bot that replies automatically? lame
@SpotifyCares @393456 We need different paying methods..easy fix
@SpotifyCares @393457 You should've already had methods like paypal and ideal. This is just bad. Ever seen a student with a creditcard? Like wtf man
@SpotifyCares Always looking out for me, so hard to stay mad at you!
@SpotifyCares Oooo got it
@SpotifyCares @393463 What's this about 60 days free? How can i redeem this?
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/t3k4Chc8VD
@SpotifyCares Have clicked the sign out everywhere button and reset the password just want to make sure no one can get into it again!
@SpotifyCares Done.
@SpotifyCares What is DM? It’s sucks that you don’t had an 800 number I want a refund dating back to premium Activation!!!
@SpotifyCares Omg! Thnx for your reply, hope it's sooner rather than later😿 @118062 give us some help! 😊
@SpotifyCares It’s back! Nevermind!
@SpotifyCares i was just wondering when the new taylor swift album is going to be on the german spotify
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response, LM. Looking forward to the update!
@SpotifyCares When’s it going to be available !!
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you
@SpotifyCares No
@SpotifyCares Model SE. Last update was 8.4.26 , done last night. Went to Tweet album was listening to, it Spotify opened the Twitte app instead of just tweeting it. Looked like this: https://t.co/kk10Ib6WSA
@SpotifyCares If this helps the album is Del Amitri Can You Do Me Good
@SpotifyCares otherwise...I love the podcasts!
@SpotifyCares it's just a bummer to listen to the same commercial over and over again when you're just trying to get the news and you PAY..   :(
@SpotifyCares thanks! I've liked all your other improvements tho!
@SpotifyCares I have dm you all of the information
@SpotifyCares thanks, I've just checked &amp; it has righted itself
@SpotifyCares No that didn’t work :( I’m attaching a screenshot of what it’s doing w/the app open https://t.co/Lo3IuLmPk0
@SpotifyCares Currently using iOS 11.0.3 and the Spotify version is 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares I've been using Spotify Premium as my main audio app on both mobile and desktop for over a year, but ok, I'll be patient while you guys figure out that I don't fucking like country. Thanks, I guess? https://t.co/mzokcVO8FB
@SpotifyCares Thanks!  Thanks for Discover Weekly as well.  Really smart feature that I enjoy
@SpotifyCares Ok I will
@SpotifyCares Nevermind its working now
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.3, Spotify 8.4.24. The app is behaving fine, it’s just slightly scaled up from iPad 9.7 inch resolution to my 10.5 inch resolution
@SpotifyCares @17470 I received an email from spotify saying that my email was changed, I did not request this change, I can not login or reset my pass help-me
@SpotifyCares Thank you ! It's really annoying ! Have a great day !
@SpotifyCares Haha thanks !
@SpotifyCares i can't search for artists, I can't play songs and everything takes AGES to load and whatever I'm trying to do doesn't work
@SpotifyCares That was a good read makes me want to learn more about @115888 where can I find more information
@SpotifyCares Maybe something that could help me figure out how to get more followers
@SpotifyCares That's why you guys are the best
@SpotifyCares Whoops, looks like it was a server issue on our end. Thanks for the quick response!
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.3 Spotify 8.4 24.506
@SpotifyCares No good  song I’m listening to right now doesn’t even show in the Spotify home screen https://t.co/R149J1JZgW
@SpotifyCares Nvm it’s fixed after I made a new playlist
@SpotifyCares Yes it is thank you for the support
@SpotifyCares Windows 10 and Android. I have no idea what version! 😂
@SpotifyCares Thx bud
@SpotifyCares Definatly
@SpotifyCares No
@SpotifyCares 15” MacBook Pro, macOS Sierra 10.12.6, Spotify Premium 1.0.66478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares Hey LOOOOOOK!!! Thank you! @335536 and I thank you! https://t.co/p1vcUJ4MQf
@SpotifyCares thanks for the info it is very helpful indeed.

by the way one of you competitors makes the claim of 100.000 Songs offline.
@SpotifyCares Uhhh I cant reply to that link?
@SpotifyCares There is t a reply button at all. I’m not experiencing an error...there is no OPTION to reply and gag post is over a year old.
@SpotifyCares No. Just work it out and make sure when I shuffle it doesn’t play the same album for 5 songs in a row 🤷‍♀️ that simple
@SpotifyCares I try to register premium. But always failed. Ok check DM thanks
@SpotifyCares Allright, thank you
@SpotifyCares Macbook Air running Sierra 10.12.6; Spotify version 1.0.64.399.g4637b02a. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I'll give it a try. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares comes back after restarting/logging out and in but then disappears hours later, don't fancy having to restart every time i load up spotify😭
@SpotifyCares iphone 7, ios 11.3 and app version 8.4.22.515, been happening ever since updating to ios11!
@SpotifyCares will give it a try!
@SpotifyCares nope, didn't work :(
@SpotifyCares password reset link is not working getting frustrated forgotten password
@SpotifyCares __email__ username laineyjg. Thanks
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s https://t.co/p082RbPBsr
@SpotifyCares Okay I’ll try it thank you.
@SpotifyCares I logged out but now I’m unable to log back in with correct information
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/VGxMMc2DMq
@SpotifyCares It’s Germany 🇩🇪
@SpotifyCares iPhone 5CE, version 8.4.22.515, iOS 10.2
@SpotifyCares It doesn't show the actual episode, it just sends me to the whole big channel https://t.co/1mmNn1NDj3
@SpotifyCares Thanks! It would be much more convenient if it directed me to the right one. Appreciate the help
@SpotifyCares Voted! And you guys should definitely do that. Especially now the new Apple Watch doesn’t need a phone for running!
@SpotifyCares My phone runs on android and it won't say error or anything.
@SpotifyCares This is happening on my phone while I'm on Wifi and 4G. I updated the app last week
@SpotifyCares I save things to a "DW Wins" playlist. That's rare company to be in for me. A like is just a nod to a good track, doesn't need to be more.
@SpotifyCares If all the liked tracks were put in a "Liked from Discover Weekly" playlist, that would be fine. I would have to be more judicious though.
@SpotifyCares As it is, with them randomly floating in Tracks, I actually have a harder time finding them again later, and that's contrary to the point.
@SpotifyCares Perfect. Thanks for the speedy reply. 👍
@SpotifyCares They're back this morning! Very strange.
@SpotifyCares Hi! Sorry for not getting back to you. I’ve got premium Spotify, on MacBook Air macOS Sierra version 10.12.6
@SpotifyCares I re-installed it on my computer and that did the trick! Thank you!! (and the problem was only on my computer, it worked on the phone)
@SpotifyCares Says "You are currently set to offline. Please go online to connect to Spotify"
@SpotifyCares Google Pixel XL1, Android 8, Spotify version 8.4.24.871
@SpotifyCares I ended up having to uninstall and reinstall the app to work. There is at least one review on the Google Play store noting the same issue
@SpotifyCares I'm having this same issue. I've had to reinstall the app once already, and its occuring again. Problem is I have to re d/l songs everytime
@SpotifyCares No, the problem is I open the app and it says im offline, so it doesn't login. But, I am connected to my mobile network
@SpotifyCares Same issue on Wi-Fi. I also tried restarting my device, no dice.
@SpotifyCares I don't have any other devices, but I listen on chrome and its working perfectly fine.
@SpotifyCares Raise it with Dev, it's a bug ;)
@SpotifyCares I tried that. Track 5 is supposed to be a collaboration with @76687 , track 14 is a collaboration with Anderson Paak., Ty Dolla $ign, BJ The Chicago Kid, and Raury. They are two completely different tracks with different lyrics and music.
@SpotifyCares This is the track that's wrong: spotify:track:2VQc9orzwE6a5qFfy54P6e 
On the album, there are two different songs called "Blessings" - track 5 and 14. The system just has the second one (track 14, spotify:track:5IdQEHgtmj9th3OkfQKhf8 ) in both spots.
@SpotifyCares I have tried with my phone (Huawei) and my computer, and it says that the song is not available
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/Wp9Bh5PbO8 It is set to Norway
@SpotifyCares I tried to log off and on again, and I tried to uninstal Spotify and downloading it again, still didn't work
@SpotifyCares is this the info you need? 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Re-download the app now it’s working again
@SpotifyCares Hi, I am in the Faroe Islands
@SpotifyCares No I've tried that as well as resetting the cache and uninstalling on both devices
@SpotifyCares It does seem to have done the trick.
@SpotifyCares Hey. I’m on iOS 11.0.3 and this version of Spotify (note the label on the bottom right): https://t.co/hPvEy98H4O
@SpotifyCares Don’t quite see how that’s going to change the label within the app but, yes, I’ve done that.
@SpotifyCares Don't think anything you do will change the software code that controls the name of the "Your Library" label so we won't get to the bottom.
@SpotifyCares Nah who would want ads I rather to listen to those pony awesome songs than watch ads every 30 min🙄
@SpotifyCares You're not funny like @159344 , HEAR THAT AND PASS ON TO THE RIGHT FOLKS /CO or what ever that means
@SpotifyCares Aww so sweet now I'm going to download the real Spotify &lt;3
@SpotifyCares I'm using a LG K20 PLUS 7.0 androidOS and idk the Spotify version I downloaded it from here bc ads are annoying https://t.co/oeIZO2TkGR
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares Well actually… Why can’t I see what my friends are listening to in like a feed without going through profile for their public playlists?
@SpotifyCares well I added a queue to my playlist so my song are not in order anymore. plus, I have 333 songs in it so I can’t remove em all 1 by 1
@SpotifyCares I didn’t want to add a queue, it was by accident and now my playlist is not in order!
@SpotifyCares You're still my No. 1 https://t.co/reacb6H8bk
@SpotifyCares i would not call them improvements tbh
@SpotifyCares It just comes back once the mouse stops moving.
@SpotifyCares Logout &gt; Restart &gt; Login &gt; Change Album = works! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares iphone 6s newest ios 11
@SpotifyCares I can't DM you
@SpotifyCares it wont let me DM as your acount isn't following me
@SpotifyCares Thank you, I'll do just that.
@SpotifyCares Really useful if I want to search through my albums by genre as well
@SpotifyCares Maybe a nice option for premium users would be to manually organize your albums into a sort of meta playlist, I think this would be [3/2]
@SpotifyCares While I love release radar, I just want to be able to sort through the albums I've -already saved- by album length and release date. [2/2]
@SpotifyCares While I appreciate you getting back to me so quickly, your suggestions weren't really that helpful. I already use Release Radar and [1/2]
@SpotifyCares Jaybird x3s. Tao tronics BT reciever and a kenwood stereo system. Because of this ive gone back to @GooglePlayMusic
@SpotifyCares S8+. Version 8.4.24.871 armv7
@SpotifyCares None.
@SpotifyCares creditcard betalen? Alsof iemand in Nederland dat heeft. Doe anders PayPal ofzo. 2/2
@SpotifyCares Ok thank you. Creditcards aren't really popular in The Netherlands u know. We use iDeal (or PayPal sometimes)
@SpotifyCares Thx :)
@SpotifyCares I mean you guys have the song but like you’re mixing the Uk artist and the Filipino artist and it got confusing
@SpotifyCares Still plays the same songs over and over despite shuffle.  My iPhone (and years ago my iPod) has a true random shuffle.
@SpotifyCares United states
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/NBeh1dmYEa

https://t.co/6ty36su78y

Country set Germany, I think. 
The song title/ album cover glitched on my computer.
@SpotifyCares Tried on Firefox
@SpotifyCares It's greyed out https://t.co/qiXtv26DBa
@SpotifyCares Thank you for solving this!
@SpotifyCares Yeah. I’ve done that
@SpotifyCares Tried that. Didn’t work :( tried uninstalling and reinstalling too :(
@SpotifyCares Can u please respond
@SpotifyCares thanks buddy just do it quickly tho
@SpotifyCares No error messages, I can turn the mobile data on in my settings for Spotify but as soon as I close my settings it deactivated again
@SpotifyCares Mac OS High Sierra. Spotify 1.0.66.478
@SpotifyCares Done. Same old. We’re having this problems for months. It only changes the length of time Spotify works ok, diminishingly.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! 
Its a Samsung S6, Android OS 7.0, Spotify version 8.4.24.871armV7.
@SpotifyCares Nope. Havr tried restarting, logging out, deleting and reinstalling app... no joy 🤔
@SpotifyCares No, not on desktop, just on mobile.
@SpotifyCares @400256 there ya go I fixed it
@SpotifyCares someone just dm’d me back hahah
@SpotifyCares just sent the dm!
@SpotifyCares Other than the moving content to a SD card,  Nothing else at the moment.
@SpotifyCares Despite the full @50582 discography being available otherwise.
@SpotifyCares But why that one album? Specifics plz
@SpotifyCares It works! Yes! There's no more stopping! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much! I followed your instructions and I'll keep you posted! Sorry I'm in night mode https://t.co/QxrBxkNo26
@SpotifyCares The ad plays but then the music doesn't. Eventually it plays it just takes a while I don't really mind but I'm curious as to why. https://t.co/7wb8vfjgaa

@SpotifyCares Hello i set up a premium family account and now when I sign in and try send invite it says contact premium account owner
@SpotifyCares I'm getting charged for premium but do not have premium
@SpotifyCares The validity period follows the latest or longest period?
@SpotifyCares Can I pay for spotify premium before it expired?
@SpotifyCares Shuffle turns itself off on my iPhone app every time it connects to my car for the last month. Was never previously a problem, have tried
@SpotifyCares Uninstall/reinstall, restarting, and making sure app is updated. Nothing has changed about my car so assuming it must be the app. I can’t
@SpotifyCares Even turn shuffle back on - it stays on momentarily but when my phone goes to sleep or I skip a song, shuffle turns itself off again
@SpotifyCares Seriously though, all I need is a print-out of all the songs I've played in the last 72 hours, or the last 50-100 songs. Can ya'll help me?
@SpotifyCares Thanks, RH!
@SpotifyCares Iphone 6s plus
Ios
Version 8.4.24
@SpotifyCares okay
@SpotifyCares im on a macbook pro A1278 using the 1.0.66.478.g1296534d version of spotify
@SpotifyCares Songs&amp;Artists
@SpotifyCares funnily enough no, none. its like spotify freezes it just stops playing music until i click on something else. thanks for the reply
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Lumia 950 running Windows 10 Mobile (latest version) and the latest Spotify app for Windows Phone / 10 Mobile.
@SpotifyCares 1. Doesn't load up past the splash screen, so can't log out, etc. 2. I've restarted, and reinstalled, without success.
@SpotifyCares One more question. I just moved my Groove music to Spotify and want to take advantage of 60 days free of Premium. I only get 30 day option
@SpotifyCares But I have a song on Spotify but I search for it my name doesn’t come up
@SpotifyCares Also, just refreshed the devices page and it disappeared again.
@SpotifyCares but none of those scenarios apply (sd card, &gt;3 devices, online daily). I even cleared devices and tried it all again.
@SpotifyCares both. They stayed in the app as my music but were removed from downloads. Should have mentioned that even tho app showed 1/2
@SpotifyCares all downloads removed, Android settings showed the app still taking up 1.5 GB 2/2
@SpotifyCares did it, but i'll try it again. going to bed but I'll get back with you if the issue returns.
@SpotifyCares just removed all my downloads again
@SpotifyCares I'm not removing. They are disappearing from the app on their own. If you mean un/reinstalling the app then yes it persists
@SpotifyCares the app still shows the space being taken up but the Playlist are gone https://t.co/Hi6akxck8U
@SpotifyCares brandonlpierce, just like the twitter handle.
@SpotifyCares Only 2 devices so did not go over limit. I put device back but it removed itself and as of now put itself back.
@SpotifyCares we have to wait for awhile before listening again
(2/2)
@SpotifyCares I wasn't complaining about ads!! open your eyes! Spotify Cares? no not at all
@SpotifyCares No, it doesn't :(
@SpotifyCares Trying to get in #Rapcavier
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares Okay, thanks 🙏
@SpotifyCares I left my email 2 years ago!!
@SpotifyCares Is it a one time thing, or will it ever update?
@SpotifyCares &amp; this happens. it just gets stuck there &amp; it won't play my music. happens with every one of my playlists @SpotifyCares https://t.co/8OjJVqMLYF
@SpotifyCares Okay. I’ll follow the steps and let you know how it goes. Thank you for responding and trying to help.
@SpotifyCares Okay I deleted the app and reinstalled but now all of my playlist so are gone 😟
@SpotifyCares No. I have done that. Didn’t help. Thanks. Any other ideas?
@SpotifyCares I’ve figured it out thanks you guys for your assistance’s in my situation
@SpotifyCares Sorry about that little corruption
@SpotifyCares did not work.
@SpotifyCares They just stop playing and I can't play them anymore, and it's not a connection issue because other albums or radio or playlists work fine
@SpotifyCares Just updated to the most recent version of Spotify and it's working.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!! 💚💚
@SpotifyCares No, it also happens in desktop app.
@SpotifyCares You already had it for roughly the last 3 months but it seemingly got pulled after the last update for the desktop program. So...
@SpotifyCares Windows. Version 1.0.66.478g1296534d
@SpotifyCares ok so i understand u making a family discount but that’s not what we wanted bros :/
@SpotifyCares thank u i love u
@SpotifyCares One plus 5, Android 7.1.1 / Oxygen 4.5.10, Spotify very 8.4.22.857armv7. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Tried. Same ☹️
@SpotifyCares I followed the step one by one. But still can't play none of Beck songs. Others are fine..
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I am happy to give my account information if needed. I will try on computer as well when I get to the office.
@SpotifyCares @386047 Thanks
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares It had like fairy lights and either words indie and love on title. Late night love or something like that
@SpotifyCares I'm looking for a playlist that had Ta-Ku, Chet Faker, Coldplay, Foreign Fields, and Wafia in. That playlist had so much memories for me
@SpotifyCares Canada!
@SpotifyCares united states
@SpotifyCares Is there any chance it will be a discount option anytime soon?
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/cB8vFWw2kA It's actually only some of the songs that are instrumental like #2
@SpotifyCares alright so what do i type in 2 get the original version?? bc i don't see another option besides the "clean" version.
@SpotifyCares No never! Any more solutions please?
@SpotifyCares Cheers mate. 😎
@SpotifyCares This isn’t really helpful, all the songs have disappeared..
@SpotifyCares iOS11.0 / iPhone7 / Spotify8.4.22.515 issue persists even on devices that have the latest iOS build. Check the thread plz. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Glad to know they’re aware of it and are on it. Thank you! 🙂
@SpotifyCares Would appreciate it if you at least acknowledged the bug and tell us you're going to fix it in the next release.
@SpotifyCares This issue has been happening for weeks now! I don't think you realise how irritating it is to use your app in my car due to this.
@SpotifyCares Sorry for the late response, but no, that didn't really help.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 5s iOS 9.3.1
Spotify version 8.4.24.506
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately, I'm still on the waiting list🙂 Were is the problem? We are EU country.
@SpotifyCares pretty much just doesn’t play offline when thats one of your main things you advertise
@SpotifyCares I’m on an iPhone and I don’t know the version. No error messages
@SpotifyCares 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Device: ASUS_Z012DA
Version: attached 

Thanks! https://t.co/Yn8Ow1EYox
@SpotifyCares Android 7.0 and no error notification, nothing happens
@SpotifyCares December 31st groove music shuts down and I cannot transfer my subscription to Spotify because you guys don’t allow it in the BAHAMAS
@SpotifyCares No message comes up except when I try to press shuffle play https://t.co/fsj8fNVaGq
@SpotifyCares just uninstalled and reinstalled Spotify and still having same issue
@SpotifyCares It also only happens for artists I've previously played their albums before &amp; followed artists
@SpotifyCares Also happening on desktop. I'm a Premium user and this sucks https://t.co/dg5HnOUwWa
@SpotifyCares still experiencing the same issues... help? refund my premium payment for this month? this is sad #brbcrying
@SpotifyCares It’s on MacBook Air, Mac OS High Sierra, Chrome. The problem is the ${date} inline where it should be the real date.
@SpotifyCares what's happening? it's an iPhone X - and you can see that spotify's interface isn't designed for the NOTCH on the iphone x. please fix :)
@SpotifyCares you don't care at all. you are liars. you've completely screwed my account now i have to yell at you to pay attention. morons.
@SpotifyCares Some other bloke with the same artist name. Keeps crossing me every now and then.
@SpotifyCares Well this happens once or twice a year, so yeah, I will get back to you someday ....  😎

Thanks for the help!
@SpotifyCares Through the artist dashboard u mean? They never respond :(
@SpotifyCares Is sorted. Just a wee delay. Ta
@SpotifyCares Japan
@SpotifyCares That’s sad, but thanks!
@SpotifyCares Yeah when I go to their page and hit shuffle play it does this and whenever I add their songs to my queue they disappear https://t.co/bJfjJbOH0D
@SpotifyCares Yeah I just did all that and it still didn't work 😢
@SpotifyCares Okay yes I just uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and logged back in and it's still the same.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+, iOS 11.0.3, Spotify v8.4.22.515 (I’m a paid subscribers)
@SpotifyCares Hi! Ive been paying for two accounts for some reason but only using one. Mustve got confused. Is there any way to have some of the money re imbursed as I've been paying double for a while?
@SpotifyCares Disconnected basic acc from Facebook in desktop app, now can't login to Basic or Premium. Reset p'word either says unknown or not available.
@SpotifyCares Nope! Browse recommended stuff...
@SpotifyCares hey! Is it possible for a user to create a scannable qr-code for spotify?
@SpotifyCares great. Is there anyone in brazil that i would able to talk to? :)
@SpotifyCares It's not like a SUPER scary ad, but still unsettling. Appreciate the response!
@SpotifyCares I have a galaxy tab 7.0, android 4.4 and previous version to last version of Spotify
@SpotifyCares So, why not put a coding function in "if user selects folder: put in a 'shuffle folder', shuffle all songs in folder"
@SpotifyCares Doh... pilot error.. Spotify not latest version. Updated and problems gone. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares P.s. wife was not happy to have EDM music blaring at 5:30am.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/kFCBiwLBYq
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Figured it out--updated app and restarted phone several times.
@SpotifyCares When I go to OFFLINE mode the downloaded songs I have will not play Doesn't happen all the time, but has happened more than once on Samsung8
@SpotifyCares It didn't the first time.. next day it worked
@SpotifyCares Hey how do I do that?!! (Link to a spotify song) :)
@SpotifyCares Well lookie here! It works! https://t.co/ojDzjmHawr
@SpotifyCares Also I reported same for Clutch months ago and it was improved but not 100%.
@SpotifyCares there is one result when you search for "Egypt"
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/zSdbOUFXSA
@SpotifyCares Some misses on "appears on" for this one, too: https://t.co/iSI3pjNPzI
@SpotifyCares Clutch is a rock band. The entries under "Appears on" that are a rapper are incorrect.
@SpotifyCares At least, if I can report that, I can’t find where.
@SpotifyCares I can report ‘abuse’ but not ‘data on this page is incorrect’.
@SpotifyCares Also maybe if it’s up to your users to catch these, how about a mechanism to report them in the app?
@SpotifyCares Thank you! We don’t want mails notifications, just a simple notification in-app. Have a great day!
@SpotifyCares Thanks babe. Kind of answers. Not on a computer so won't be able to do it x
@SpotifyCares Thank you xxx
@SpotifyCares thx for the quick reply. Dell Ultrabook Latitude E7470. Windows 7 Enterprise. Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated!
@SpotifyCares No error messages. The web player is just very unreliable. It works periodically. Mostly freezes. Doesn't matter which laptop I use tbh
@SpotifyCares I primarily use chrome. I believe it's happened in IE as well
@SpotifyCares ah i ended up sorting it out with vodafone, thanks though!
@SpotifyCares C'mon guys... It's been YEARS: https://t.co/Yp0pVdoJi1
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8, iOS 11, and free Spotify. Not a single song in my playlist plays. It’s all recommended songs.
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares The problem is still not fixed.
@SpotifyCares Awesome, cheers
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares spotify:track:6eT0nmfsRo1WzAq333RFJ1 Also you'll be able to compare the song to this one on other services if you need
@SpotifyCares thank you so much! Have a nice day! :)
@SpotifyCares Actually got it fixed from you guys already. You were awesome thanks
@SpotifyCares Thanks, will send thru email.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/lZzwJyD9yq
@SpotifyCares Neither.
@SpotifyCares Whether its initial active period matches the latest payment date or starts after the previous ending period
@SpotifyCares But that means duplicating playlists. Can I not buy more devices for 1 account?
@SpotifyCares it's not recognizing any of my usual passwords, and none of my emails are receiving the forgot password email
@SpotifyCares for now I'll just block all Spotify notification at the system level, but can revisit if/when there is control on that one. thx.
@SpotifyCares Didn't do anything wrong just fucking hate how much I depend on you, ya know?
@SpotifyCares The spotify app on iphone
@SpotifyCares THANK YOU!!  👏🏻💃🏼👏🏻
@SpotifyCares it was working until you messaged me.
@SpotifyCares press play - nothing happes. no error msg. mobile works well. desktop app always problems.
@SpotifyCares Living in South Africa 🔥
@SpotifyCares Guessing the guy on the 'Courage...' album needs his own new page, looking at artist results when I search on the name Eddie James
@SpotifyCares That's it 🙂
@SpotifyCares I'm in the US. Yes, this is a French release, but it was on the US Spotify for years and now it's not available.
@SpotifyCares It's working, now. Thank you, though.
@SpotifyCares Hi, already done ALL of that. Still nothing.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6S. iOS 11.0.3. Unable to control anything outside of the app. No volume, lock screen, control center or Bluetooth controls
@SpotifyCares Alrighty. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares It wasn't loading because I didn't have any unthrottled data volume left, so I switched it to offline.
@SpotifyCares They did on the device, but only until I had a proper connection again.
@SpotifyCares It’s set to the United States.. I live in America
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much me and the whole TLC army is looking forward to stream left eyes music and keep her memory alive
@SpotifyCares And music doesn’t come back on after scrolling past. Makes twitter/Spotify combo unusable. Mega :( :( :(
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6S/iOS 11.0.3
@SpotifyCares I think that did it! Thanks
@SpotifyCares I'm from Peru
@SpotifyCares I keep pressing "shuffle play" and its not playing the song(s) ...
@SpotifyCares Continues to say "this song is not available."
@SpotifyCares I've done that. still nothing. here's a screenshot of what it says when i try to play a song. https://t.co/7oTQ5nbSRQ
@SpotifyCares Wi-Fi or wired. Still the same. Rather odd.
@SpotifyCares Samsung GS7 edge android. It also happens on my desktop. I'm running win 10
@SpotifyCares Now it's says "this song is not available" on 90% of his songs...
@SpotifyCares Then I've done what I can, I guess
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I was hoping there was a way to populate an unplayed list using all my podcasts like the mobile app vs going through each podcast.
@SpotifyCares Thanks 😘
@SpotifyCares @407803 same problem here. Canada is great, besides Spotify exclusives being only in the US. Like I pay for a membership and only get 80% access? ☹️
@SpotifyCares @115888 How come I was able to see the Bad Liar Spotify vertical video ? But not the Wolves video ... Canada isn't like some foreign country ....
@SpotifyCares thank you
@SpotifyCares Happening on my Samsung S6 Android 7.0 app version 8.4.24.871armV7
@SpotifyCares This is an old complaint, but Spotify does not care. I have a S8 phone and a S2 tablet, both with the latest version of Android.
@SpotifyCares English then: can I still get student discount when I already have premium?
@SpotifyCares Random then? Oh well. It is what it is i guess. Fingers crossed☺️
@SpotifyCares ...I can assure you I am....send me one please 😉
@SpotifyCares iphone 7plus, ios 11.0.3, spotify version 8.4.24.506, did that and it didn’t work.
@SpotifyCares that worked, thanks homie! 🙏🏽
@SpotifyCares When searching a song, &amp; trying to select it. It chooses a 🎶 2 ⬇️ instead of the one I hit. I then have to tap above the 🎶 for it to play.
@SpotifyCares Hi! Thank you for being so nice. I’m from Italy and I couldn’t see Wolves exclusive video on Spotify, probably because I’m not from US. 😊
@SpotifyCares Thank you! The single is great! I have Spotify Premium and I enjoy the single every time I want. 😊♥️
@SpotifyCares So it’s not available in the UK?
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!
@SpotifyCares hey 👋 - disappointed in response times here. no reply via email and i assume it will go to the changed email address. hello?
@SpotifyCares no, i just click the shuffle play button and nothing happens, i try it with a different playlist and it works
@SpotifyCares yes, like it'll start and then randomly after 1 song it'll stop playing and then i can't click it
@SpotifyCares See the red circle? Ignore that Pandora logo (I'm not sure what that's doing there). The browser is chrome. https://t.co/SF4nQtkEI2
@SpotifyCares wait whaaaaaaat when did this change come in? o.O
@SpotifyCares but I mean like..... is there an official announcement saying somewhere saying you no longer share the activity on FB?
@SpotifyCares I don't mean a personal one, I meant a public one so everyone can see cause you're probably gonna have a few other wondering why their music isn't showing on FB anymore either
@SpotifyCares Wait I thought there was one! He instagrammed it!
@SpotifyCares I can’t play/find selenas new video
@SpotifyCares Australia
@SpotifyCares And also this one https://t.co/oI8ETjJzQ3
@SpotifyCares Thank you. I’ve dropped @159550 an email 🤞🏾
@SpotifyCares Sounds good. Whenever it IS available, is there ever a way to purchase those tracks to take beyond Spotify? I know it's your unique content.
@SpotifyCares Now i cant use the app at all. What am i supposed to do to fix this?
@SpotifyCares When i clicked the Spotify app, it took too long to load and then the application was not responding that i had to force quit it
@SpotifyCares Not really sure but it’s been months (2 or 3). Yes i have tried rebooting my Mac but that didnt work out either
@SpotifyCares I’ve tried clearing up local caches and uninstalling Spotify for a couple of times but those didnt work out
@SpotifyCares Spotify app in my Mac which runs in MacOS High Sierra (10.13) cant be opened, why?
@SpotifyCares Yep!
@SpotifyCares Nope!
@SpotifyCares Nexus 5x, Android 8.0.0, Spotify App v 8.4.24.871
@SpotifyCares Yeah, but that was already suggested at the start of 2016 with no replies until last week. That won't help me saying anything.
@SpotifyCares Got one, thanks
@SpotifyCares Thanks anyway :) I just wanted to know whether data analytics positions are ever offered in Manchester, and are all internships in summer?
@SpotifyCares When connecting my iPhone and opening Spotify, it either won’t react and stays on black screen or plays without audio. Always have to disconnect the cable or first open Apple Music and THEN Spotify. Only then it works. Very very very annoying
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.3 - @115888 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares It works perfect wirelessly. That’s not the problem. Apple CarPlay only works with a cable on my car stereo, and that’s when the trouble starts with Spotify
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares I sent a DM explaining what happened. If there is something I can do to get this situated, please let me know. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Now it’s alright :)
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the offer! Turns out that my Spotify acct can be both accessed via FB &amp; a username/pw combo. Didn't realize &amp; was only fixing FB.
@SpotifyCares Though this doesn't seem normal AT ALL. Thought I made my acct w/FB only. Are Spotify accts supposed 2b accessible via 2 diff logins???
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the answer. I have no other way to play spotify on the tv. The options given are not available for me. I'll have to wait longer
@SpotifyCares Alright thanks! Hope it gets sorted out right away
@SpotifyCares Nah the video feature is still not working for non US fans
@SpotifyCares thanks so much for the reply!
@SpotifyCares Ah! I do that *most* of the time but I still feel like my algorithm is messed up, ha ha! I'll be more strenuous about it from now on.
@SpotifyCares Apple IPhone 6 https://t.co/zGlVHPa6OD
@SpotifyCares Thank you. @52249 get your album on here please!!!!!!!!!!
@SpotifyCares It isn't working... Tried several times. https://t.co/sDzvh0vI1o
@SpotifyCares Thank you! i’ll check this out!
@SpotifyCares I'm aware of all of these things. Thanks tho
@SpotifyCares Yes sir, thanks 👍
@SpotifyCares Osx Sierra. MacBook pro 15"
@SpotifyCares Yeah, there is JS error once you click the sign up button https://t.co/uiZmTOxzJy
@SpotifyCares just tried, there is no luck. if not worse. https://t.co/9rL1SxFvTp
@SpotifyCares I highly doubt it's the connection
@SpotifyCares I've read that yes, but I mean the actual playlists itself, not the tracks in the playlists. Instead of doing that manually.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares thanks, i connected through the form. seems like iTunes is the culprit, and I'm just getting lumped into their restrictions, not Spotify's
@SpotifyCares Oh wow never realized that was there! Awesome, thanks! Hope your developers keep upgrading that video option to include more.
@SpotifyCares I understand. Thank you very much for reaching out. Much appreciated ❤️
@SpotifyCares @410649 It would be really nice if you guys archived the videos and had a place for members to view all spotify videos in one place.
@SpotifyCares Thank you! I'll definitely check the voting thing out. I really appreciate the response to my nitpicky critiques.
@SpotifyCares 😒 already am. https://t.co/GJQVqe160m
@SpotifyCares I'm trying to set up a third account under the family one, but I keep getting an error when I try to add it.
@SpotifyCares @410858 I'm from Canada and it's still not working ://////
@SpotifyCares hope so. is it just me or others with this problem?
@SpotifyCares Okay, so @28646 @44809 is the album gonna be available in Mexico? It was at first, issues began to appear yesterday
@SpotifyCares Version 8.4.24.871 and moto g4
@SpotifyCares Downloading to internal shared storage now. Will be limited space left when done
@SpotifyCares No. The option for it does not appear. Not even greyed out. Nothing.
@SpotifyCares Oh sorry. Android version is 7.0
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the swift reply
@SpotifyCares Sweet!
@SpotifyCares No, but it does shuffle only within the first 50-100 songs. No songs past that will play in shuffle mode
@SpotifyCares I have a lot of practice in turning it off.  Sadly.
@SpotifyCares I know it reloads 🙂 it's been doing amazingly perfect for 1.5 years and I really love it.I'd just like to give better feedback if possible 😉
@SpotifyCares Nah still there.. can’t only be me?!? 😟
@SpotifyCares Yes. I did. It was an ad for UNH
@SpotifyCares App didn’t crash. Was playing music whole time. Didn’t close out of it either
@SpotifyCares I'm interested to try premium, can I buy it by using my debit card?
@SpotifyCares That’s not going to get my music back. That’s days, weeks, and months of listening, and collecting.
@SpotifyCares I changed my password and email.
@SpotifyCares I'm Pixel XL, Project Fi, Android 8.0.0, Oct 5th patch, and Spotify 8.4.22.857.  Crashes and restarts repeatedly on share attempt.
@SpotifyCares Hey, that worked!!! Thank you! The issue with the app should be fixed by you guys tho’ ...biggest problem is that there is no SAVE function to save the new chnages after selecting NO...
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6S iOS 11.0.3, spotify version 8.4.22.215
@SpotifyCares Cheers 😊 hopefully i see it pop up sometime soon 👍 its a great album
@SpotifyCares This is wonderful news bless your soul♥️
@SpotifyCares Totally understand :-) ❤️
@SpotifyCares happening over everything listed.  restarted device multiple times.  trying to log in but can get passed the connect online part
@SpotifyCares working again.  thank you🤘
@SpotifyCares cannot screenshot due to security policy
@SpotifyCares I found the switch and turned it off. Thank you
@SpotifyCares Same on all browsers (Firefox 56, Vivaldi...) on all platforms (Windows 7, Debian 9)
@SpotifyCares @spotifycares macOS Sierra 10.12.6 thanks for helping!
@SpotifyCares I'm using the desktop app on my mac and the mobile app on my nexus. I have the same experience on both devices.
@SpotifyCares I've tried all of these. I sent a message using the French form. They unsubscribed me to investigate deeper. Now I can't listen to any music
@SpotifyCares Logging out and back in seems to have worked for now, I’ll let you know if it happens again.
@SpotifyCares I’m using the iOS app, version 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares try and play a song.   It will not play and it is not giving an error either.   It does it on both my laptop and phone.
@SpotifyCares Yep, your support team sorted it out last night in no time – thanks a lot for your help!
@SpotifyCares So.... it's been awhile... still not fixed.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/VN5FWJdDty
@SpotifyCares Well it's been another four months. #SnailsPace
@SpotifyCares Ummm...so it still says Would instead of Wound. #SecondhandEmbarassment.
@SpotifyCares Lovely stuff. Thanks for your help 👊🏽
@SpotifyCares How long do you think it will take for the issue to be resolved? Lmk thanks
@SpotifyCares u took my jams away and now ur throwing it in my face
@SpotifyCares Well, that's not a good thing since #Windows7 was released in 10/2009.  :P
@SpotifyCares @115888 for Windows needs an overhaul anyway. This is basically the same app from the #Windows7 days, right?
@SpotifyCares Nothing
@SpotifyCares You’ve had Android Wear since June 2015
@SpotifyCares Sure, but will that un-download all my downloaded playlists?
@SpotifyCares Done that! Video prob doesn’t make much sense but it didn’t play the one I tapped once. https://t.co/g1SBhqd75h
@SpotifyCares This time I kept tapping 2nd result “School Song” https://t.co/j7hw7Xdzw3
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 running iOS 11.0.3, Spotify version 8.4.22.515.
@SpotifyCares Ok do I’ll create Spotify account with their Facebook account and then link it to the family sub. This should be easier for younger kids!
@SpotifyCares I’m using an iPhone 6s with iOS 11 and Spotify version 8.4.24
@SpotifyCares Followed your directions exactly and still no :((
@SpotifyCares It’s currently happening over WiFi, but I’ve also had this problem while on data
@SpotifyCares Windows 8.1, almost every time I open Spotify it doesn't load any pages and I have to restart it
@SpotifyCares thanks!
@SpotifyCares Surely there's a more convenient way...haven't been a student in years and have been paying full premium price for months as a result...
@SpotifyCares Album was in my groove library move over to Spotify
@SpotifyCares Ok you just cancelled any further involvement with Spotify
@SpotifyCares U.S.A
@SpotifyCares What they should would help torwards overall revenue torwards the percentage they (we) get
@SpotifyCares New Zealand .
@SpotifyCares I can play it on my computer only. Using an iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 11, I believe. It’s grayed our on my mobile playlist even after download
@SpotifyCares I believe I've done everything here. Same WiFi, .mp3 format, etc...
@SpotifyCares Did this and still not working :/ I've had local files work in past but can't get this
@SpotifyCares Failed again
@SpotifyCares many song from my playlist has disappeared, i hv search fot it but i didn’t find the song that was on my playlist before. it’s ourgabsoonost
@SpotifyCares The phone I have is a Samsung Galaxy s7 active. And I'm using this version https://t.co/a88ppYuuGZ
@SpotifyCares Yeah it works
@SpotifyCares Well when I try to play music it says it can't play at the moment And when it does play it plays 1 song then it stops after the song is over
@SpotifyCares ios11 - iPhone 8+ - version 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares I just want to shuffle my songs in my playlist so I don't have to listen to the same order over and over...
@SpotifyCares I have found the shuffle on Spotify webplayer... and now i feel dumb. Thanks for caring anyways. :)
@SpotifyCares Thank you! Already in the midst of responding to you support staff. 😊😊😊 #promptsupport #kudosSpotify
@SpotifyCares Done - almost 10,000 votes for this feature... is anyone really listening?
@SpotifyCares You sound like a bot, you know? The issue is all over your community.
@SpotifyCares anyway it can be removed or explanation why such charges? thanks (2/2)
@SpotifyCares Sure thing!  Thanks for responding. I am using model #MGLW2LL/A and Spotify 8.4.20.535. IOS 11.0.3
@SpotifyCares My music pauses itself constantly and that's when the app isn't freezing. It just started this today. I'm using an LG G5 with Android 6.0.1
@SpotifyCares It happens on Wi-Fi and data. Also, I have the latest version of Spotify.
@SpotifyCares I tried this. It seemed like it worked at first but it's back to doing the same thing.
@SpotifyCares @413941 You guys need to work on your algorithm for how you shuffle songs as well, too many repeats.
@SpotifyCares No the newer one with Cynthia Erivo 😭
@SpotifyCares Thks, so no news....ill stick with @1122
@SpotifyCares that there is an error when I have all of the information correct.......
@SpotifyCares I believe it’s the phone.  I listened to a podcast in a different app and it did it as well.  Thanks for checking!!
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/An49PSNnXj this is the song link
@SpotifyCares the problem is not the description on the song itself, it's actually the ad about the song as seen in the screenshot I attached. https://t.co/RXD4GJtgYi
@SpotifyCares Thanks a lot! Hope to see it gets fixed soon
@SpotifyCares :( that’s too bad but thanks for the reply and explanation
@SpotifyCares Hi thanks yes I found that. I changed payment AND country but it still says the old country in my account. Any ideas?
@SpotifyCares There is a lot of people that would like feedback from that team
@SpotifyCares thank you sexy
@SpotifyCares Okay
@SpotifyCares or this : https://t.co/HvQxHfxfT5
@SpotifyCares This is what i wanted to hear thanks M and thanks for this ..But are u doing something to put down those sites yourself ?
@SpotifyCares Have restarted app, rebooted Macbook, logged out &amp; back in to Spotify, ran the installer from the website, no change to the date. 🙃 https://t.co/cS8pCHWNBb
@SpotifyCares It doesn't seem to matter what album &amp; is same for me on multiple computers. Friends w same albums unaffected. Might be an account thing.
@SpotifyCares this is not a professional approach to support. the dm text box is too small to easily write and review a detailed message.
@SpotifyCares DM sent, thanks.
@SpotifyCares Hadn't tried that, I'll give it a shot.
@SpotifyCares Still skipping and now had a Loreal commercial start playing for about 10 seconds in the middle of a song.
@SpotifyCares Chromebook and router have been restarted with no change.
Seems to be playing fine on my PC.
@SpotifyCares Samsung Galaxy S7 running Android 7 (September 8th update) and Spotify 8.4.24.871 armV7.
@SpotifyCares No errors or messages, just a 5 minute lag on interactions and the fallout where it won't load *any* content after close or force quit.
@SpotifyCares Done that now. Will follow-up when it breaks down again 😉
@SpotifyCares yeah it does that on my sister's account
@SpotifyCares cause it doesnt make buzzing noises on my PlayStation 4
@SpotifyCares when i put my phone on a table it starts to make noises but its fine in my hands or in my pocket
@SpotifyCares 1) follow me if you’re better than Apple Music 2) the US I live here
@SpotifyCares Sorry, on a Samsung S5, I thought maybe my phone was too old
@SpotifyCares Hi. Please review my DM.
@SpotifyCares thx !! :)
@SpotifyCares Desktop App that is!
@SpotifyCares Windows 7 enterprise. I can load library and artists but nothing will play. Have checked Chrome settings, deleted cache etc.
@SpotifyCares Restarted PC - no joy. But started listening on phone then Spotify Connect kicked in and allowed me to revert back to web player -ta da! thx
@SpotifyCares Cheers!
@SpotifyCares Can you guys pls notice me!!!! Wtf!!!?
@SpotifyCares Help!!!!
@SpotifyCares So I just logged into my account to check my email address, and I can see my country is changed now. So no worries, but thanks
@SpotifyCares it has now spread to the arctic and foster the people sos
@SpotifyCares i don't know what you guys did, but i've never been so happy to listen to an artist again
@SpotifyCares yes and more, thank you ♥️
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares yes.
@SpotifyCares yes i know. but id pay 2 more dollars if that limit was like 10,000 and it was up to the paying consumer if they would like to spread it across 3 devices or not. Nobody carries 3 devices in their pocket. Not your demographic   anyways..
@SpotifyCares Is that going to possibly change? I'd be willing to pay a little more or a one time fee for more space.
@SpotifyCares Thank you for getting back to me.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/4GX21HmsKq that was the original link I have to the track....
@SpotifyCares Should be set to UK
@SpotifyCares It was recently. What changed ?
@SpotifyCares Yeah I’ve done all that, the version is 8.4.22.515. I don’t blame Spotify. Apple is just petty because they want everyone to use Apple Music
@SpotifyCares I have no idea ? I just open the app, go to my playlist  and hit shuffle on my drive to work. Not sure what spotify connect is
@SpotifyCares But that's possible via music distribution networks? I see @23039 podcast and couple others on Spotify. Or it is personal agreements?
@SpotifyCares I hope so too because I'm on a really tight budget rn haha😅😂
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much ☺☺ It helped a lot..
@SpotifyCares I’m using an iPhone ! https://t.co/budYYzgWL2
@SpotifyCares Ill give it a try when I can get to my car and give you a shout!
@SpotifyCares I used to get a Spotify icon under sound in this menu, but it doesn’t show up anymore https://t.co/qsh8Xzi23e
@SpotifyCares Hiya, I’m running iOS 11.0.3, car is a ’17 BMW 1 Series, i tried them yeah, didnt seem to change anything!
@SpotifyCares Ill give this a go at lunch and get back to you - nice one
@SpotifyCares Still not working :(
@SpotifyCares Using Spotify premium -seems to be an issue with the new Apple iOS rather than you guys though?!
@SpotifyCares Version 8.4.22.515?
@SpotifyCares doesn’t really help but idc
@SpotifyCares Ich will. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Hmmmm, seems I cannot pick a Bewerbung password. Incorrect token. 🤔
@SpotifyCares No, sorry. Because it suggests resetting my password – which doesn't work. See below. https://t.co/NVRmXKyZR0
@SpotifyCares I sent an e-mail to __email__ – does that count? ;)
@SpotifyCares nah, no error messages. the play/pause/skip hotkeys on my keyboard just aren’t working anymore https://t.co/hnx8Zwn7RE
@SpotifyCares just tried logging out and back in and it didn’t fix it, but have safe booted/restarted and it fixes it for like one song haha
@SpotifyCares will try this tomorrow after work and get back to you!
@SpotifyCares I reinstalled and nothing has changed D:
@SpotifyCares yeah! mac, high sierra, and spotify 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02??
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response hopefully you get it fixed fairly quickly.
@SpotifyCares Thanks, @SpotifyCares, but this thread started in 2012, your last update was in 2016. I don't think Spotify is serious about this. https://t.co/xvXuVd59WJ
@SpotifyCares Thanks, just that and I'll be happy.
@SpotifyCares hey my spotify premium is not working i paid with my cc and i don't have it yet 
my mail is  __email__
@SpotifyCares @416376 hey my spotify premium is not working i paid with my cc and i don't have it yet
@SpotifyCares Mac OSX Sierra - 10.12.6
Spotify - 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares The old trusty "Have you turned it on and off again?" - Yes, I shut my computer down every night.
@SpotifyCares Already on, still opens links in browsers.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the info
@SpotifyCares Doing just fine but the sharing options is quite a mess. I miss the old versions. Simple and easy to use.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! That's awesome news!
@SpotifyCares Hello im using a laptop on windows 10 and im using android phone.
@SpotifyCares Yes im unable to play on both devices. Laptop version: 1.0.65.320. android version: 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares Ive tried that its still the same
@SpotifyCares @73063 @73064 @73065 @73066 @73067 @73068 @73069 @125633 Thanks but I hope you can fix those licensing issues soon! We hope we get notification too once okay. Thank you 😊
@SpotifyCares Can't wait. We miss those songs already 😭 Thank you!
@SpotifyCares here’s the full info. https://t.co/QbUZ9TRuoQ
@SpotifyCares Restarted already still not working. https://t.co/gIHNYQcjiT
@SpotifyCares Okay it works!
@SpotifyCares You could've just said no....
@SpotifyCares I’ve done that but I want to be able to swipe down to display the now playing view 😭
@SpotifyCares It shows behind album art but as soon as I swipe down, wanting to dismiss the now play screen, it brings lyrics to the front
@SpotifyCares I’m using my iPhone and it is the latest version I updated it not too long ago
@SpotifyCares Yes thank you!
@SpotifyCares Part 3: My account is set to the US. 🇺🇸
@SpotifyCares Part 2: the music will start playing, but sometimes it stops all of a sudden. And then sometimes I press “Shuffle Play” and nothing happens.
@SpotifyCares Part 4: I’m on an iPhone 6S, iOS 11, Version 8.4.22 and I’m not getting an error message.
@SpotifyCares Part 5: As of the moment, the issue seems to have disappeared, but like I said, it was spotty earlier.
@SpotifyCares Part 6: The issue is occurring again, but only with this artist. Logging off/on didn’t do anything.
@SpotifyCares Part 7: I reinstalled Spotify and the issue is still occurring. Y’all should probably check for a bug within the app.
@SpotifyCares Part 1: The issue is spotty (pun intended) Sometimes I’m able to press “Shuffle Play” on Dua Lipa’s self-titled deluxe album and the...
@SpotifyCares Samsung Galaxy s6, Android 7.0, and Spotify 8.4.24
@SpotifyCares So far, it seems to be working. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares @189197 So, no? Not now?
@SpotifyCares Did you confuse the norwegian bigbang with the korean bigbang?
@SpotifyCares No, I’ve been on this update for about a week.
@SpotifyCares I have both restarted and reinstalled.
@SpotifyCares Spotify 0.7.89 Beta
@SpotifyCares i love the fact that you guys care about every tweet *applause*
@SpotifyCares I can't remember what username or email I used so I am paying spotify premium but can't login
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/6NoQK7INsn
@SpotifyCares @417449 Just make that stupid app! More than 7000 people should be enough
@SpotifyCares my friends say the link(s) works for them, but they won't for me:

https://t.co/Crx3tIvQGd
and
https://t.co/PHn4z9BIs6
@SpotifyCares haha! love you @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Great! Thanks for the support guys.
@SpotifyCares how many votes does it take to make @115888 think about it?
@SpotifyCares omg aksgsh i love mellow songs, calming music like harry styles maybe, i just really need a playlist that can lift my spirit up ya feel?
@SpotifyCares Not really. I was wondering what "a few days" actually means. But ok... I will wait :) Thanks for your quick reply!
@SpotifyCares No error messages. From ps4 via spotify app and from spotify option when you hold the ps4 button to control it from the dashboard.
@SpotifyCares From here it the songs never changes after pressing play all or it will restart the song when im in game. What can be done about this. I can't be more clear than this. https://t.co/HurYjuUd0M
@SpotifyCares None of these are relevant to what ive described...
Seriously.
@SpotifyCares everything cost money.
@SpotifyCares Thanks 🙏🏻
@SpotifyCares Hi again, tech support could not find anything. Could you please tell me if my Spotify premium account is associated with a psn account ?
@SpotifyCares Its not that theyre suggested, its that theyre all gorillaz. It played DARE twice.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/7RK1ddd4zb
thanks for the fast response. All the songs from this album (Gore) got a fake leak. From there comes the conflict
@SpotifyCares I get that, but telling me that GPS tracking is handshaking with my music app just comes off creepy as hell.
@SpotifyCares All good, thx. Sync glitch. Seems OK now
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/lt60NsiGGl
@SpotifyCares I don’t see a Waze option. https://t.co/UB6ok10Lr6
@SpotifyCares This is restricting me as a user to have a good experience using Spotify for no clear given reason. (It's not technical, not for ux, etc)
@SpotifyCares Hi! I have 9226 songs now and can't add more albums
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares Hey, the issue's all fixed now. My card was charged today. Thanks! 👍
@SpotifyCares @417891 still can't listen to my babies on my Mac :( what's happening spotify
@SpotifyCares no :( my phone works fine, its just my Mac
@SpotifyCares DM? Direct message? hehe obviously not a tweetter guy
@SpotifyCares Hi. Thanks for replying. I’m afraid it’s *not* been in tune with my musical tastes for months now. :(
@SpotifyCares Sure thank you for you quick respond
@SpotifyCares When playing a playlist on Wi-Fi or mobile data, it refuses to play the radio based off the playlist, I have made sure it's switched on.
@SpotifyCares Samsung GS8, Android 7.0 and version 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares I have already followed these steps but no joy yet
@SpotifyCares I'll try that and yes it works perfectly fine on my laptop
@SpotifyCares I have forced closed the app, checked for updates and reinstalled. Same issue
@SpotifyCares Sure, everytime I attempt to start playing some songs i get an ad. Then the songs never start playing. No error message
@SpotifyCares Version 8.4.24.871
Samsung galaxy s7 edge
@SpotifyCares You saved my coworkers a whole lotta heartache.
@SpotifyCares Hi, ty for sincerly trying to help, I wrote a second message this morning and this one wasn't answered with copy &amp; paste, but ty anyway :)
@SpotifyCares all of Frank Ocean's discography and also Kendrick's.
@SpotifyCares I can’t find it on mobile 😭
@SpotifyCares Iphone! https://t.co/YZKlGtU7B3
@SpotifyCares Well holy smokes you guys are awesome. Great customer support! Bravo!
@SpotifyCares Thx for the reply. I was just giving you guys a hard time is all. When I think Halloween music, first thought is White Zombie or Rob Zombie
@SpotifyCares Hello, I’m not getting an error message. I’m just getting a page that doesn’t let me input my code and it’s saying tickets aren’t avail.
@SpotifyCares Amazing! Is it possible to transfer my favourite songs from Deezer to Spotify???
@SpotifyCares Mac + Chrome. And FYI it's been happening for the past few days, so I don't think it's a momentary bug.
@SpotifyCares Yes, it does happen in incognito. Can't reset router, unfortunately – office-wide connection. Any other troubleshooting ideas?
@SpotifyCares Hey. Windows 10 and 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares last couple of days it starts fine, but then if you've not played anything for a while and then try and play something it's freezing the computer
@SpotifyCares Yeah it works grand when you restart the comp, 150 GB free space - I see other people are having trouble with this version too after googling it
@SpotifyCares That's exactly what happens
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much for replying, I'll look forward to it!
@SpotifyCares Not quite, looking for the version in Reservoir Dogs?
@SpotifyCares That's the one :) thanks so much for your help
@SpotifyCares Seemed to fix itself but will try this in future, thanks
@SpotifyCares S8+, Android 7.0, Spotify v 8.4.24.871armV7. This always happens when new feature rolls out. Everything breaks during slow deployment.
@SpotifyCares @419334 Don't boycott Selena again. This is a lack of respect with Selena, Marshmello and the fandoms. Please solve this problem. https://t.co/tMDlAnhEkY
@SpotifyCares Also in my profile I can only select Germany, but I'm not a German citizen insofar!! want to use this upgrade so bad.
@SpotifyCares Is there another option to upgrade my account to premium? Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I should look for new glasses as well.. I didn't see this option at first! Works now. I'll extend after the free trial period :D Thanks &lt;3
@SpotifyCares Thanks! One more question: For listening offline, do I just have to add my songs to a playlist or can i add them to  "library"?
@SpotifyCares Or better said: How can I listen the songs offline, it doesn't work if I put the connection offline and they are in my library.
@SpotifyCares Do something we're not taking it this time around
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/8kncuUD9yN
@SpotifyCares Hey tnx for the answer! I’ll just make sure that my sister tries to login on her computer first, if it doesnt work I’ll tell you! Tnx
@SpotifyCares Heey!! Im having problema with my spotify family again ;/
@SpotifyCares Problems***
@SpotifyCares There's no point. You'll tell me to get Spotify Premium to turn the "Suggested Songs" feature off &amp; I'm broke. Am I right? I'm sure I am.
@SpotifyCares That doesn't always work.
@SpotifyCares @419522 Super waardeloos idd. Ik gebruik nog een oudere desktop versie, waar het gelukkig nog wel kan.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Idea is a bit different and am talking about the app, but I’ll open a topic over there.
@SpotifyCares Got it, thx! https://t.co/IEw996JusY. @419523 @366223
@SpotifyCares That didn't work
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares Nope. Sorted now. Might be an idea to say somewhere that you'll only accept email addresses in lower case? That's 30 mins of my life!
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!
@SpotifyCares the song can't be played because it's not selena gomez. it was sabotaged. fix this
@SpotifyCares i don't have the link but this is the problems that some people are facing
@SpotifyCares Thanks. For paying users make constant banner-ad crap like this opt-in. Stop wrecking your brand.
@SpotifyCares DONE! Thank you so much! I love you guys and that was excellent customer service! I just couldn’t do the Waze anymore 😂
@SpotifyCares oh sorry, they were undownloaded
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/cI4mqeR6fZ
@SpotifyCares When on wifi. Its not bad wifi either.
@SpotifyCares Didnt work, also tried uninstalling. Didnt help.
@SpotifyCares Just tried on my tablet. Songs played fine. Went back to phone. Makes a skip like every 2 seconds.
@SpotifyCares Great! Thank you. I just switched it off :)
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the reply! We love country hits, pop-punk, and top hits!
@SpotifyCares Thanks. May be single most demanded feature. Can’t happen soon enough else risking an exodus of users to Apple Music.
@SpotifyCares Yes.
@SpotifyCares An iPhone SE and yes this is the first time I’ve seen this.
@SpotifyCares Yes! Thanks for getting back to me so fast!
@SpotifyCares I did not! Thank you so much for your help!
@SpotifyCares No error messages it stops at the end of a song and doesn't play the next. It's on my IPhone 5s. Version 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares Now this happens I'm so confused... https://t.co/UH3mRapWnY
@SpotifyCares Happens with all of my songs and it happens on wifi and while on data
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 11.0.3, Spotify 8.4.24.506
@SpotifyCares Yes but the problem returns
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you
@SpotifyCares Android Version: 5.0.2
Model Number: SM-S920L
Spotify Version: 8.4.23.784
@SpotifyCares It worked! It just took a minute! Thank you so much!
@SpotifyCares Think it was just an iPhone issue thank you!
@SpotifyCares It plays for about a song and a half and then the app shuts off. Also BT readout doesn't change songs on phone or in car/BT speakers.
@SpotifyCares I'm on the Galaxy S8+ and version 8.4.24.871 armV7
@SpotifyCares I've done it all, multiple times. It resets temporarily but then reverts right back.
@SpotifyCares Hmmm, Skylar Grey and maybe surprise me a little? Do you need my user name?
@SpotifyCares This album: https://t.co/oEqMwcDxoB is not from this band: https://t.co/KzmJjkoj4g
...And it's ruining my smartlists :P
@SpotifyCares Appreciate it!! If they fix this (see Photo) then Originals will go head to head w/ my Netflix! https://t.co/aEB74IcRGw
@SpotifyCares Dang :( thanks anyways.
@SpotifyCares No it played one song and then played more ads. I don’t think it crashed at any point
@SpotifyCares Yes I did but it’s not a big deal, just gets kind of annoying sometimes
@SpotifyCares It's the UK :((
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares I did run an update this morning/reboot everything but still not letting me rearrange stuff. This is the current version I have now: https://t.co/hMULZf4fvo
@SpotifyCares My songs won't play...
@SpotifyCares Google Pixel
Android 7.1.2
Apps on both Android and PS4 are fully up to date.
@SpotifyCares I am still waiting after emailing, using the community and twitter.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the fast response and passing my feedback to the dev team!
@SpotifyCares Didn’t there used to be a Spotify inbox? I want to send something on Spotify if poss
@SpotifyCares Thanks 👍🏼
@SpotifyCares Windows 7, usu when I hover over Spotify icon on the taskbar I get controls for music. Missing. Restarting Spotify didn't help
@SpotifyCares Was too lazy to do that, but it's working now. Just needed to restart computer i guess.
@SpotifyCares Okay you win this round... https://t.co/DbK9zledpK
@SpotifyCares I hope so ❤
@SpotifyCares And this is not set offline https://t.co/seEeBVAKb4
@SpotifyCares It’s working now, thanks
@SpotifyCares Thnx
@SpotifyCares Matje you can help me. I don’t know my e-mailadress anymore
@SpotifyCares And I using my same card were you guys take my payment
@SpotifyCares __email__
@SpotifyCares So problem fixed
@SpotifyCares Thank youuu❤❤❤
@SpotifyCares i'll try in a few days if i can for that.
@SpotifyCares I only use chrome, it stops and freezes whenever I doing other things.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/RBgYaU9b97
@SpotifyCares I just rebooted a second time.. it's functioning again 🔥🔥 thank you for your time and effort✨
@SpotifyCares Yep . Same issue
@SpotifyCares On a Huawei P10 lite version 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares None whatsoever. The music just won't play
@SpotifyCares I was . But now I also can't play the song . It's an Android
@SpotifyCares Finally got around to trying it and no that did not work. It plays one song and then doesn't move on and makes it so I can't play anything
@SpotifyCares This seems to have worked thanks!
@SpotifyCares Apple iPhone SE, iOS 11, and newest version of Spotify.
@SpotifyCares Even play any song from the playlist, a different playlist etc. it just won't play I've already exited and went back into the app many times
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, iOS 11, version 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares Thank youuuuuu ☺️☺️☺️ https://t.co/3WXz0yz0ji
@SpotifyCares 2: Been a subscriber and advocate since the US launch but I can't stand this "feature" any longer. Time to move on I suppose : /
@SpotifyCares Thanks... there's tons of 3+ year old community articles marked 'not at this time', so I'm not holding my breath.  I'm running away!
@SpotifyCares Why is there an option to turn it off when it doesn't turn off?
@SpotifyCares I don't like it because it removes the one hand ability when swiping down.
@SpotifyCares Im running High Sierra 10.13. I’m not too sure about Spotify version but it’s the Spotify Free
@SpotifyCares And the long # when I click on About Spotify is 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares Is it because he snaked @54374 beat?
@SpotifyCares uk! (england)
@SpotifyCares yes they only have the japanese versions
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the fast response and consideration.
@SpotifyCares I already solved it. CTRL + F5 helped ;-)
@SpotifyCares But I have only a debit Card. Can I do the payment with this Card?
@SpotifyCares Debit card is not available for Colombia. Only the option for pay with credit card. 😭😭😭😭 https://t.co/31otkwBRAr
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7(11.0.3), Spotify(8.4.24). Thank you!   🤘🏼🤘🏼
@SpotifyCares Yes it did. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares all of my songs have deleted but i still have my playlists
@SpotifyCares they were saved
@SpotifyCares TYVM!
@SpotifyCares Why haven't I noticed a change in the shuffle then 😭
@SpotifyCares Thank you. We are waiting
@SpotifyCares Thanks for letting me know! Can I also ask if it's more based on what I'm currently listening to, or what I've got downloaded in library?
@SpotifyCares You guys are the best 😘
@SpotifyCares How does that make sense? I create playlists because that is what I want to listen to, why add totally random tracks to it?
@SpotifyCares Cool.
@SpotifyCares I've paid the subscription for 1 month ahead. If I stop it, will my account still in premium for 1 month ahead?
@SpotifyCares Thank you! I appreciate it :D
@SpotifyCares Yes I can confirm
@SpotifyCares I’m on an apple iPhone and I just got the latest update 11.0.3 and I think the option has been gone since then :(
@SpotifyCares Tried logging in and out and it didn’t help. Spotify version 8.4.24.506
@SpotifyCares Thank you very much, I shall do so 🤗♥️
@SpotifyCares the new ui is beatiful and all, but i think ill rollback and pray to god you guys fix this .
@SpotifyCares you see this is very lame , and kinda illogical, why can't i get to my library while offline ? doesn't make much sense to me.
@SpotifyCares the now playing was quite different, i was using the new one (screenshot will show the now and then ) the new design its bugged i think https://t.co/WtwhD8KDuP
@SpotifyCares glad to help ,we're friends https://t.co/x2LOuK1wWH
@SpotifyCares most of the time i use the mobile version is when im not connected to the internet , so this is kinda of a big deal breaker for me.
@SpotifyCares im one of those guys that listen to entire  albums at once ,and the playlist menu to me is kinda all over the place. do i have to roll back?
@SpotifyCares as you can see in these two screenshots the meno changes while you're not connected to internet in this new version of the app https://t.co/S6OqaVTZRn
@SpotifyCares Is this the oly way to put my songs on Spotify cause i ve sent my info to two of the companies listed but no one has answered yet
@SpotifyCares i didn't find spotify url on mobile but i have normal url https://t.co/c96mfDzRz9
@SpotifyCares What's the cost for premium
@SpotifyCares Thank you. My account is set for the US.
@SpotifyCares it’s actually my ipod it’s not a phone.
@SpotifyCares oh it worked! thank you!!
@SpotifyCares So I have to wait and https://t.co/Ylhu9WQOFo Thanks! :D
@SpotifyCares I'm using OnePlus 5 runnin android 7.1, Spotify 8.4.23.784

@SpotifyCares The album is on there. In reality it has 12 songs. Only 10 are on Spotify... the title track is one of two missing.
@SpotifyCares No it doesnt crash. I watch the video and then the “thanks for watching” video comes next and then boom 3 ads pop up
@SpotifyCares Yes all 30 seconds of it
@SpotifyCares Its keeps happening im sad
@SpotifyCares 😍👂 tysm. It truly has the potential to save 2017
@SpotifyCares That’s it!  Y’all rock.  Thank you!
@SpotifyCares I’m listening now https://t.co/TquMv3DotW
@SpotifyCares What doesnt sound right
@SpotifyCares So when I play it it loads but doesnt start playing the songs
@SpotifyCares Samsung version says in the Pic I don't know what operating system it is https://t.co/W0s4x81ukm
@SpotifyCares No worries I'll try that Good idea
@SpotifyCares Feedback? This isn't feedback. This is a site breaking bug. I can't use your product because I can't hear it over the car commercial.
@SpotifyCares Win 10. Chrome browser. No, sorry. If I hear it again, I'll reply.
@SpotifyCares Tried it, tried clearing the app data, tried uninstalling even tried factory resetting my phone even if I download or don't it doesn't play
@SpotifyCares I have and it does play the songs that don't play
@SpotifyCares No errors, if I'm in the middle of a song and tap on the song that doesn't play it immediately stops playing music
@SpotifyCares Nexus 6p running on oreo
@SpotifyCares Restarted the app several times and all is well in the world. Was quite a scare though 😓
@SpotifyCares Is there any explanation as to why we can't get the music at midnight Eastern?
@SpotifyCares If Apple Music is releasing them at 12:00 Eastern Time you guys should be as well
@SpotifyCares Could it be up in a few hours?
@SpotifyCares I added local files  2 a playlist  — atm, I can’t find them on my iphone playlist. There’s also no option to make them “available offline.”
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Chromebook. For some reason, this is what I keep getting when I try to start the album. https://t.co/nC0yqR0opV
@SpotifyCares I tried and it didn't work. I even tried logging out of my account and back in and that still didn't work.
@SpotifyCares *no
@SpotifyCares Yup just checked 3 or 4 artists and only like 30 songs in the queue. This is also on mobile if that makes a difference
@SpotifyCares It only seems to be an issue on mobile works fine on desktop. But it did it with artists I was and wasnt following and dont have songs saved
@SpotifyCares Every time I click shuffle it just plays the songs on the "this is" 😕 am I doing something wrong?
@SpotifyCares Gracias!
@SpotifyCares I been shouting. I want to access my library on my Roku. I’d also like the repeat function to actually work.
@SpotifyCares Sure, it’s 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares No, no error messages. Apple’s own music app just responds to the headset commands even if the Spotify app is playing.
@SpotifyCares restarting seemed to do the trick. Cheers! :)
@SpotifyCares Hi your link that you sent is error 404 cannot found, pls check about it. Thanks ;)
@SpotifyCares Yes, I tried already. https://t.co/A1TqPe6zqp
@SpotifyCares this link can but it's not in Thai.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 running latest iOS and latest app update too. Works when phone restarted but not for long!
@SpotifyCares Your app doesn’t show in the lock screen when playing anymore 🤷🏻‍♂️music plays in background, have to open app to change song/volume..
@SpotifyCares Still not working 🤷🏻‍♂️
@SpotifyCares Hi, my account has been changed to free, but in do pay for premium. How do i get my premium back?
@SpotifyCares shit, here I am totally complaining. thanks very much
@SpotifyCares Yes its all good 😊 Your help worked 🙋
@SpotifyCares Oh wow. Really didn't expect a response. It's Android. And it's only been the last week or so
@SpotifyCares Yes it only happens on 4G. I have no idea what version I'm using
@SpotifyCares But it only happens with Spotify? Nice handball thanks for nothing
@SpotifyCares Awesome, thanks!
@SpotifyCares it's finally solved btw
@SpotifyCares I’m using the latest version of Spotify (v8.4.22) on an iPhone SE through the app.
@SpotifyCares No, it did not.
@SpotifyCares 8.4.24 on iOS11 and the latest client on windows 7 (idk version no. But just downloaded yesterday)
@SpotifyCares Try it all including delete the app and reinstall. Unfortunately it won’t work:/ region lock? Is it possible?
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/r96GTZmpEc  The artist name should read “King Majik” but right now it’s just “Majik”
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares That's what you've been saying for months. Unlike Journey, I've stopped believing.
@SpotifyCares "I know you messaged us in August and it's November now, but the same *hopefully soon* is the best we got for you."
@SpotifyCares I also had this chat with your Facebook team. They said they had devs looking into it.
@SpotifyCares Sorry I haven’t received the DM
@SpotifyCares Sadly, it did not. Still won’t play.
@SpotifyCares Can’t play this artist either: https://t.co/DwDNBnUeDQ
@SpotifyCares iMac (macos 10.12.6), iPhone (iOS 11.03) Spotify (ver 8.4.22.515)
@SpotifyCares I've tried everything I think you guys need to update it I'm on ios 11 iphone 6
@SpotifyCares It gets hot when i use speakers but with my earphones my phones start to cool down issue happens when speaker is in use
@SpotifyCares My phone speakers
@SpotifyCares @431325 Jangan bagi dia, nanti spam lagu syirik
@SpotifyCares It got worse!
@SpotifyCares @431543 Yeah... Yela said “worldwide now” i guess it means only in US even if you signed up for the early access....
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/S3P0Lb801B The albums from ‘96-2000 match artist bio. The singles from ‘16-‘17 are a different band.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I checked in on it and the singles have been fixed, but noticed “appears on” includes a reference to the other artist (2017 album).
@SpotifyCares Please. TYVM! &lt;3
@SpotifyCares (2/2) ONE fix left. It is this one song: https://t.co/N7LL8cPVq4, we keep it on Rift's but change the Cluda to https://t.co/AeaVD76eKj
@SpotifyCares Any news on this one? ^^
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.3 Spotify 8.4.24.506. Thanks
@SpotifyCares That seems to have solved it. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Another questions:if I download an album w/ 12 songs does it count as 13 because of the album?I think I read that somewhere but I’m not sure
@SpotifyCares PC desktop, just stuck on the advert for the survey. Refreshed, did the survey, no change.
@SpotifyCares Hmm I'm only using one offline device, so unless it removes them when it updates the app I'm stumped. Thanks anyway
@SpotifyCares i am on an iphone7plus
@SpotifyCares i can see all my playlists but my saved songs are all gone https://t.co/hZuDuQcY11
@SpotifyCares I think I got it!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 iOS 11.0.3, 8.4.24.506
@SpotifyCares I am trying to find a song I listened to. I don't remember the artist or name and I can't find a song history
@SpotifyCares It was a song that featured Pretty lights, tipper, or Anderson pak
@SpotifyCares I don't. It was like a 15 minute song that featured 1 of the artists I mentioned. Will my email address help u access my account
@SpotifyCares So much for the cavalry
@SpotifyCares Unrelated*
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, iOS 11.0.3, Spotify version 8.4.24.506. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Yes! Also unable to use my car to change songs while through Bluetooth or the usb.
@SpotifyCares Everything worked! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Seems to have sorted itself now, wasn’t downloading the page, thanks for getting back to me though😊
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/PfHM0zMR4Q  I'm in the US
@SpotifyCares That message appears for every song on the album https://t.co/U9z3bdrLCw
@SpotifyCares Still the same "song is unavailable" message when I do that
@SpotifyCares Been there and done that! No luck. I know I'm not the only one in my area having the same issue. Are we just unlucky for a few days?
@SpotifyCares If it helps: I'm getting infinite reload permanently, and it runs through about 5 songs then just stops responding.
@SpotifyCares IOS 11.1, spotify stops playing when I operate other apps like twitter and fb (esp scrolling down and liking tweets)
@SpotifyCares Other thing I noticed is it stops playig occasionally when I exit the app. It also plays fast forwarded on its own
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/CQwNILZmbS
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your help, 
Sincerely yours.

@SpotifyCares it says there isn’t any payment found. I would be happy if we work on this together to fix the problem.
@SpotifyCares and Spotify took the package price 6 times(it’s on pending in my bank account). When I try to use my premium account
@SpotifyCares (2/2) please can you refund the payment just now and I will activate my new subscription?
@SpotifyCares Im just giving a suggestion for u guys to build some features in desktop version so users able to communicate with others. Thats it haha ty
@SpotifyCares DM sent with all the info...
@SpotifyCares Iphone and mac, both of them have the latest spotify update
@SpotifyCares Yeah both, I mean I'm using the same account on both of them anyways so
@SpotifyCares Ah no only on my phone
@SpotifyCares UK
@SpotifyCares How about you just kick them off of your platform. They make bad music
@SpotifyCares Majid Jordan’s “The Space Between” and Big KRIT’s “4Eva is a Might Long Day”
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply guys, I'll keep my eyes out 👀
@SpotifyCares All good. I'm taking care of it rn with someone online rn. But thanks lol
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares incognito mode didn't work.  other browsers didn't work either.
@SpotifyCares Tried Firefox and Chrome, same issue.  IE didn't work at all.
@SpotifyCares You only have Age Ain't Nothing But A Number. Where are her two other studio albums and her posthumous compilation album on @115888?
@SpotifyCares It’s 8.4.22. When I block my screen it doesn’t show anything related to Spotify as it used to. (1/2) https://t.co/DU26MVJ5q2
@SpotifyCares Also, if I press the button of the EarPods to play/pause, Apple Music native app starts playing. It looks like iOS doesn’t recognize Spotify
@SpotifyCares Didn’t work, I tried yesterday 😔. The thing is that it used to work okay when I first installed iOS 11, could it be because of v8.4.22?
@SpotifyCares Dm sent.
@SpotifyCares Cant seem to find it on the actual app itself
@SpotifyCares Oh, I see. Thanks-
@SpotifyCares @433416 hope it won't take 3 hours for it to get fixed ...
@SpotifyCares well sure, but why not just display it :) I want to discover new music, but as a premium user it’d be nice if it was just there to click on.
@SpotifyCares thank you :) I didn't know the correct spotify to direct this too. have a good day!!
@SpotifyCares I'm still staying on Spotify, nothing beats it, but I'm sad I won't have the same listening experience as yesterday...
@SpotifyCares Delayed response but yes this has helped so far! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Absolutely not! Would be nice to know if a song has been placed in a playlist though. I'm loving it!
@SpotifyCares Absolutely! You count on it. 👍
@SpotifyCares I'm already on the list. Can you please tell me when is expected (year) to do Spotify in Slovenia?
@SpotifyCares When will malaysia's spotify release yelawolf's album-trial by fire? Bcs he just announced that his album was release
@SpotifyCares Both Android app and the web player in Firefox.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/DFnA2MZDmY
@SpotifyCares I love you
@SpotifyCares Maybe add a button to dislike songs that you don't want to hear more of? It's been like this for maybe two months now
@SpotifyCares I am using chrome. My browser keeps saying oops something went wrong. And would like me to reload.
@SpotifyCares No luck still. It could be the server blocking it. I am not sure
@SpotifyCares Private network through work. I have not had this issue and been using for a year
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/k55U4j6csV
@SpotifyCares Got it! Yes we do want all the music! Lol Thank you so much for the reply! And... Fingers crossed! 😊😊🤞🤞
@SpotifyCares Thank you, so much for replying - but I solved the problem without knowing what i was - and how I did it.
@SpotifyCares Thank you very much for letting me know
@SpotifyCares I got an email to join the family package but it keeps saying something is wrong
@SpotifyCares ok I just received it got it thanks
@SpotifyCares still no answer, do I have to delay my song ?
@SpotifyCares Voted for it, but I cannot stress enough how bad of a decision it is to ignore 2FA at this point in time. I hope they change their minds. https://t.co/IoN0G3ey7r
@SpotifyCares Yes, that solves my problem. Thanks!!
@SpotifyCares My friend account got hacked (she doesn't have twitter rn) what should I do to solve that? This device suddenly connected to her account https://t.co/rNIkVzWVgf
@SpotifyCares Her playlist and downloaded song dissapeared, and had changed into latino song instead of Indonesian song She created / downloaded.
@SpotifyCares Alright thanks 👍
@SpotifyCares When can I expect the service to be launched? Is there a timeframe?
@SpotifyCares I've also disabled it.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s iOS 10 and the latest spotify, it updated a couple days ago.
@SpotifyCares I can't update the iOS as I don't have enough memory on my phone to do so.
@SpotifyCares It seems to be okay now 🙂
@SpotifyCares It keeps saying it can't connect to PlayStation Network, when I'm indeed connected, and won't let me do anything.
@SpotifyCares I have tried logging out and then back in, it doesn't seem to help. I'm connected via wifi.

It works if I use my phone and have it play through my PS4, but the app on my PS4 doesn't work at all. I've tried uninstalling it too, to no avail.
@SpotifyCares 80’s, hair bands, 70’s pop/soft rock, reggae. That’s not too eclectic is it? Any marching band music?
@SpotifyCares Even includes marching bands and drum lines. Thank you spotify.
@SpotifyCares 36.1Gb free 
Spotify 8.4.24.871armV7 
Android 6.0

When I set the storage to SD card, after the reboot it is again set to internal storage.
@SpotifyCares seems to have Worked. I have only tried to delete data and Cache. Reinstalling seemed to the Trick.
@SpotifyCares UK 🙃
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the suggestions @SpotifyCares - Unfortunately getting the same result. Infinite prompt to reload + skipping songs. No music. :(
@SpotifyCares Chrome version 62.0.3202.75 &amp; also tried IE 11.1770.14393.0 and Firefox 56.0.2
@SpotifyCares Using a LAN connection.
@SpotifyCares 😉 BAHAHA U REPLIED
@SpotifyCares Already contact you through customer service. Tq
@SpotifyCares playlists are working normally. i updated spotify app this morning. any suggestions?
@SpotifyCares i don't have anything else to try with right now, but i've never experienced this before
@SpotifyCares everything seems normal now thanks yall
@SpotifyCares Yes I am getting it. Only 12 hours later than I’d like to. Maybe caching issue in app, because songs say “added 17 h ago” in playlist now
@SpotifyCares I mean, click on the Spotify link=&gt;app opening notification alert and were in the app. Would be great to implement this
@SpotifyCares Worked this morning. Must have been a glitch.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/O4zfe5rbqO
@SpotifyCares It's an iPhone 5 OS version 11.0.3
@SpotifyCares Seems I had to log in on my desktop + phone at the same time... It's working now!
@SpotifyCares It was working until today
@SpotifyCares I was previously on a free two year trial  my son is on the plan and his works  my won’t    Says I need premium  I paid for premium
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/i65quhfgNL
@SpotifyCares emails saying payment wasn't received and to update my payment method. app is ok
@SpotifyCares It appears I've forgotten the email which I use to log in! And when I try with my username the password is wrong!
@SpotifyCares Pannekoek, ik wil gewoon een liedje spelen. In Dutch or English, whatever. En 'email' is een soort brandverf.
@SpotifyCares Second (this is a usability thing): I was looking for a song of The National. 
Search box nowhere to be found.
@SpotifyCares Yeah, I know. Didn't find it fast enough.
@SpotifyCares 🙌🏻 thanks, humans! have a lovely weekend
@SpotifyCares Thank you! I will reach out to them!!!
@SpotifyCares I just wanted to know if you care https://t.co/7H1Hi6x8vs
@SpotifyCares No i don’t get a message. Like if i skip a song all the music stops - or if i pick a new album to shuffle it just won’t play anything
@SpotifyCares Probably about 2/3 days! And no restarting it hasn’t helped really, i was thinking about deleting and downloading it again! would that help?
@SpotifyCares i’m on my iphone and no it’s not premium ☹️ but it’s been doing it for a couple of days. and i’m not sure what Spotify version i’m using
@SpotifyCares @205426 Thank you 😊❤
@SpotifyCares Streaming isn’t working, for ex. I can’t listen to any of the xx. And all my offline playlist disappeared.
@SpotifyCares (By the way I do not have Premium )
@SpotifyCares My Operating system is Android and the version of Spotify is 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares Nope
@SpotifyCares Tried it, but it's not deleting them from my list still. Why can't there just be an option like the rest?
@SpotifyCares Thank you for responding, I hope it goes back on the app soon.
@SpotifyCares Ok I have the info. It's no been classified in the UK. It's out today, and advertised on Spotify for release today.
@SpotifyCares Can't believe you are so prompt. Forget my problem, you're so divine. Your social listening abilities are super awesome. Rspkt
@SpotifyCares thanks for the reply and information, much appreciated :)
@SpotifyCares Is this the official playlist?
@SpotifyCares I've been using Spotify as my exclusive music player for almost 7 years and I never listen to remixes.
@SpotifyCares i have a premium account, but the account connected to alexa is not premium. want to disconnect the old one and switch to my premium account
@SpotifyCares Gotcha! Thanks for the reply.
@SpotifyCares Too late. Xoxo https://t.co/W8xJLlVelj
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Just seems odd that there isn’t a simple way to curate preferences for ads.
@SpotifyCares No error messages, but when I click play on any song, artist, or playlist, nothing happens. Attached is a screenshot- the ad won't go away https://t.co/VSQdTYMSip
@SpotifyCares Still having the same problem! It seems frozen on that advertisement...
@SpotifyCares Cool! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Pls
@SpotifyCares I tried to buy Spotify premium w student discount and when I put my payment info in the site told me there was something wrong with (cont)
@SpotifyCares my provider so I exited out and stopped attempting, then later in the day I saw a charge of $5 to my account but I don’t have Spotify
@SpotifyCares Premium, my account is still “free”
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I have an iPhone 6 and I’m on Spotify version 8.4 it looks like.
@SpotifyCares I just deleted the app and reinstalled it yesterday, so it should be.
@SpotifyCares It did for a short period. Then it just reverted back to locking on 1 song. I can change song from widget. It just doesn’t show right song
@SpotifyCares Hello Spotify! Any update on this?
@SpotifyCares Hello Spotify! Update: it worked for majority of the day and then it froze early afternoon. If it matters, I use Bluetooth headphones. Thx!
@SpotifyCares Or give us clean version playlists of charts etc then we have a choice.
@SpotifyCares You're not listening. Customers have been asking for an explicit filter since 2012. Five years and nothing done.
@SpotifyCares I deleted the app read downloaded its shut down my phone and made a new account and it still is doing it
@SpotifyCares Yes it doing it for everything.   https://t.co/elADsyTg3w
@SpotifyCares Just got everything settled thanks to Florijoy on the @SpotifyCares team. Thanks for the quick response!
@SpotifyCares Dang, sorry fam for calling y'all jackasses. I'll be looking for it to come back
@SpotifyCares Yeah it does thx!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6,iOS 11.0.3 and Spotify version 8.4.24
@SpotifyCares Awesome! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares It says I need to go to https://t.co/2PBI9rYRiZ to use my premium account, but that link/website is broken.
@SpotifyCares Here you go https://t.co/fFg365XXkA
@SpotifyCares Cool! Thanks for the reply! I've now voted and I hope it comes back. Keep up the great work! 😊
@SpotifyCares Yeah. Tell you what, I'll PAY to have ads playbover my music. What a fucking genius idea. Glad you brought it to my attention.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Something like $4.99 a month for 20 hours. It's just not a value if you are an infrequent listener.
@SpotifyCares +1 to that...
@SpotifyCares @115888  Can we introduce a thumb up and down for DW and RR playlists like radio?
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the canned response. Not an answer for my question though. But good try!
@SpotifyCares Apple iPhone: whatever the latest software
@SpotifyCares The most updated version of Spotify on both Android and Mac desktop
@SpotifyCares That didn't work
@SpotifyCares As well as hardwired ethernet
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/HxACwlNLKm my country is set to US, no changes were made to that. I actually can't listen to anything by that artist.
@SpotifyCares Uninstalled it.. reinstalled.

All working now.. thanks!
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares Desiigner,Matsubs,Alan Walker, Imperial March,Deaf Kev,SOB X RBE,Not Your Dope. Basically, Rap Music and electronic Music
@SpotifyCares Matsubs I'd Love to change the World (Remix) and dats it..
@SpotifyCares The USA or Puerto Rico are not on the country list...
@SpotifyCares I'm using xiaomi redmi 3s. But it happens also when I'm listening from the website😥
@SpotifyCares The username is alarasati05
@SpotifyCares It was on Chrome, but it seems to be working fine now. I think there might have been a server hiccup.
@SpotifyCares @181186 please help.
@SpotifyCares I'm currently on iPhone 6, ios 10.3.3 and Spotify 8.4.22.515 version. Just for additional info, no offline songs/playlists.
@SpotifyCares Nope. I'll just re-install the app to save us both the time. Just curious as to why's there no 'clear cache' option? A complaint since 2014
@SpotifyCares @16134 please check your dm:)

@SpotifyCares Jessica Jung didn’t release that song. You should have only her releases under name.
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares hey it’s me, ur neighborhood bird. im on my pc using the Comedy Central website to stream aaaaaaall my favs
@SpotifyCares When I click certain songs nothing happens. Same thing happened to my friend
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8, and I’m running the most up to date iOS and Spotify
@SpotifyCares Tried both. Neither worked
@SpotifyCares How to unsubscribe my premium spotify? My account has no unsubscribe button. Please help.
@SpotifyCares I'll try, thanks :)
@SpotifyCares Didn't change anything.
@SpotifyCares 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3, macOS High Sierra.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/HhdSSOdJh6 but it doesn't work anymore this method apparently.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/2vnOVzgod5
@SpotifyCares The volume works but not next, prev and play.
@SpotifyCares Oh! The instructions to change password needs to be updated. I didn't use Facebook.  Thanks for the help.
@SpotifyCares Is the only way to change my password is to reset it?
@SpotifyCares It’s an iPhone 7 running the latest versions of both iOS 11 and Spotify. Songs won’t shuffle at all when connected to Bluetooth in my Mazda CX-5.
@SpotifyCares No luck
@SpotifyCares Bupkis. And I’m not the only one with this issue. https://t.co/Gv50Zi20qp
@SpotifyCares It started as soon as my phone updated to iOS 11, back in late September. Shuffle works fine everywhere but in my car on btooth.
@SpotifyCares thnx!!
@SpotifyCares before the new album art came out, the quality was fine, compare it to the youtube and you’ll notice the difference
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/CetTce7fiZ
@SpotifyCares Hmmm. Apparently the idea already has 9,685 votes! And it's been open for 5 years? Is there anything with *more* support than that?
@SpotifyCares It's literally only any and all of her songs? Any other artist works. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Hmm.. no errors on iOS (Windows ver says "Song not Available"). Selecting a St. Vincent song, nothing plays. If added to queue it skips them
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.3, 8.4.24 beta (can't be a beta thing since it also happens on Win/Mac/browser player). Win 10/Mac Sierra latest Spotify versions
@SpotifyCares Would I have to repeat it on all devices before trying again or per device? Tried it on just my phone (unsaved all the songs too), nothing
@SpotifyCares It worked on my Mac, but not my iPhone. 🤔 Is there another way to force clear the cache? Logging out and restarting didn't work
@SpotifyCares So i have to make a playlist that is just the one album in order to listen to it normally? That's terrible
@SpotifyCares And I'm sure my concerns will be ignored, because you guys make more money from one advertisement than I will ever see in my entire life.
@SpotifyCares I have an iPhone 6s, and I’m running premium version 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares It’s happening through both of them and I haven’t.
@SpotifyCares so as expected, worked for a bit, now doesn’t. I can’t reinstall spotify every time I want lock-screen controls tbh...
@SpotifyCares No error messages, just says the songs aren't downloaded(sometimes on the artist list it'll list songs I have but I click in and it says I need to download). iPhone SE iOS 11.1.1, Spotify app 8.4.27.895
Thanks!
@SpotifyCares It’s this one but I can’t really play it. Not the link you sent me.
@SpotifyCares Replied to you!
@SpotifyCares check your message, I still can't apply my gift card to my account, please fix this asap
@SpotifyCares I already wrote in the link you provided ... your support page is in fact useless
@SpotifyCares problem solved! Thanks
@SpotifyCares The issue was on a new macOS device with a fresh installed Spotify client.
@SpotifyCares Nope, same issue. Cannot tell which episodes are already played on desktop.
@SpotifyCares iOS v11.1.2 Spotify v8.4.27.895
macOS v10.13.1 Spotify v1.0.67.582
@SpotifyCares Lenovo Ideapad 300. Windows 10. Spotify v.1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf

Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Desktop app is unusable at this point. That seems quite wrong, given this rig is brand new, with a fresh copy of the OS running.
@SpotifyCares No error messages, responsiveness gets progressively more sluggish until music stops playing when the system freezes.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/tBtLxE80BR
@SpotifyCares It worked! Thank you so SO much !!
@SpotifyCares Not yet, im on it
@SpotifyCares Iphone 6, 11.0.2 and version 8.4.25
@SpotifyCares I didn't know to be like music it had to be under 3,333 songs what is the title after that many songs saved? Music Connoisseur?
@SpotifyCares I'm not gonna carry an Ipad or a 55inch tv to listen to other songs wtf. How is a music steaming service who takes money from me limit me???
@SpotifyCares I signed up! It took the €4.99 out of my account but I don’t have it can you look into for me ?
@SpotifyCares Thank you I’m gonna sign up now
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Latest Spotify, Sony Z5 Compact, Android 7.1.1
@SpotifyCares Checked the list I have done all.of those things.
@SpotifyCares Won't affect my playlists I presume?
@SpotifyCares This will be the 4th time I've downloaded them.

They become available offline for all of a week or so then I have to do this all over again. I'm sick of it.
@SpotifyCares Excellent. Keep up the great work 👍
@SpotifyCares It worked now I just refreshed the page like several times but thanks for ur help! I’ll do that next time! 🙂
@SpotifyCares I use google chrome. It seems to be working now. 😊
@SpotifyCares I figured it out!
@SpotifyCares Smoke and Mirrors by Demi Lovato?
@SpotifyCares cool thanks
@SpotifyCares Yes but I don't see all the songs of the album, I live in the Netherlands
@SpotifyCares Well it’s a work computer so I don’t have a lot of permissions, but heard from a friend I was not the only one.
@SpotifyCares I use chrome.
@SpotifyCares Just have chrome. And theres tons of security on this computer since it’s a work one. Seems to be more stable now
@SpotifyCares Well it’s happening AGAIN today. Clear cache/cookies and it continues to crash in chrome.
@SpotifyCares It’s so random, hadn’t done it ever before when I first contacted you guys. And now it has randomly resolved itself again. I’ll try incognito next time it does it, but I know someone that this happened to in another country the other day.
Looking straight at you @SpotifyCares 👀 I need my music or else I may have a mental breakdown
@SpotifyCares do i have to create this on the radio tab or on the stations heading of the library tab on android.
@SpotifyCares Oh ok. I already have premium and am from the US. I was mainly thinking about if it will work while I am traveling.
@SpotifyCares Ok, thank you so much 💕
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/mRbqQmPthL
@SpotifyCares I've just restarted, nothing, I have over 2000 songs downloaded, and I've somehow gained 1.16gb storage.. it makes no sense
@SpotifyCares downloaded the desktop EXE version of the app and it started downloading files to my phone immediately after I added my music in
@SpotifyCares Looking like as attached https://t.co/gG6s7B95nG
@SpotifyCares Ok, thank you!
@SpotifyCares Hi, one it’s a Volvo V40 D3 2017, the other a Citroen C4 hdi 2011, in both usb works fine w a regular ipod, and Itunes on the iphone as well
@SpotifyCares I’ve tried that, it manages to connect but I can’t browse with the car’s controls...maybe it’s really an iOS issue😒
@SpotifyCares I tried it but it didn’t fix the problem, doesn’t show tracks on radio screen (only iTunes tracks), cant browse files with car controls ☹️
@SpotifyCares Hi! No it was more for the fee he just paid few days ago... Will that be pro rated and refunded to him, or it will just be lost? Thx!
@SpotifyCares Will do when he returns thx!
@SpotifyCares it sucks i want her back
@SpotifyCares Thanks!  Do the other ones disappear?
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I'm loving Spotify. ❤️
@SpotifyCares Yes it is
@SpotifyCares Idk the beat is just weird. I have the iPhone 7 and I just updated it today. I also have the most recent Spotify update
@SpotifyCares Same problems my friends have been complaining about. One of Why Don’t We’s song (these girls) the beat got changed and it’s more high pitched now.
@SpotifyCares Here is 5 pages of forum posts of people having the same issues with their Spotify and Mazda cars. https://t.co/4qhRiswDm1
@SpotifyCares Yes! That did the trick.  Thanks for your help!
@SpotifyCares I apologize, but my problem is back. It was shuffleing my songs this morning on my way to work, but now it is not working again for whatever reason. It’s doing the same thing as before where the shuffle light goes off as soon as the song changes.  Please help!
@SpotifyCares Sure, iOS 11.1.1 and Spotify version 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares Thanks - my problem on that point is I only listen offline on one device, why can’t I save 9,999 songs then? I would assume that is a licensing issue that you can’t change. My downloads only work when I’m in the app, I can’t minimise the app and it carrys on very frustrating....
@SpotifyCares I had to re-download all my offline playlists upon switching iphones and noticed the downloads seems to work when you’re in the app and not in the background when the app is minimised.
@SpotifyCares Spotify version 8.4.27
IOS - 11.1.1
Device - iPhone X
@SpotifyCares Well I’ve already downloaded my playlists now so there’s not really any point for me now to troubleshoot this issue but thanks anyways
@SpotifyCares Desktop and Mobile Apps, mainly seeing issues with the monthly listeners.
@SpotifyCares Still waiting:(
@SpotifyCares when my friends play the stranger things playlists, they get the easter egg to work and for some reason mine won’t work
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/UMZ1dHLpdE
@SpotifyCares i have an iphone 7, ios11, and i have spotify premium
@SpotifyCares 8.4.24.506
@SpotifyCares it works now!! thank u!!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+, ios 10.3.2, spotify version 8.4.24
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the help
@SpotifyCares I want to buy the premium package but I can't until my Rogers service runs out in 5 days. How to I save my playlist and downloads?
@SpotifyCares Why would anyone think that me pressing play on my desktop app should make my phone start playing the music? That's idiotic.
@SpotifyCares I found it! That sucks, I’ll be sure to remember!
@SpotifyCares BS. If you intended to fix it there wouldn't be a year old thread raising this issue marked solved with no solution: https://t.co/S9LpcekoVQ
@SpotifyCares Yes, but how do you remove a song from the playlist WHILE in the music player? Clicking the three dots doesn’t give you the option -_-
@SpotifyCares Thank you 💜
@SpotifyCares what is a DM?
@SpotifyCares email address: __email__
@SpotifyCares Eek yes!! It won’t show up on my Spotify app though!?
@SpotifyCares Yea i read it,but still..So many great songs but they will never be on spotify cus they need to pay for it or the artist are already dead ☹️
@SpotifyCares im using my dell laptop, windows 10 and it says on about spotify that my version is "1.0.64.403.gb738707f (Windows Store version)"
@SpotifyCares its working fine thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thanks, but I changed the pw three more times and it finally worked.
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares Still, I just played a playlist of 13 songs today with 7 songs I like and 6 songs I don't, and it played all 6 songs I don't like for the first 6 songs.. this is weird
@SpotifyCares You don't have any Slade music at all but here's the karaoke version: https://t.co/rEi1TJbx7p
@SpotifyCares Cool, thanks Spotify ✌
@SpotifyCares I would like to manage my family subscription. But on the account overview says that i'm not subscribe to any premium accounts.
@SpotifyCares Nope, it hasn't crashed on me once
@SpotifyCares Yes I do. I'm playing it at work. I don't have to to switch it off for an ad
@SpotifyCares I am part of a premium for family package, but when I am logged into the app it says I’m on a premium trial.
@SpotifyCares lol I'm drunk 🍻 cheers
@SpotifyCares It's a song that's missing on Spotify of the #FinallyItsChristmas  album
@SpotifyCares Yes it"s there, nr 3. How come it doesn't show on my app?
@SpotifyCares It is! My friend in the UK has the same issue. It's a Samsung galaxy S7. Android 7.0. Spotify 8.4.24.871 armV7
@SpotifyCares No need, when I search for it now it shows 14 tracks instead of the 12 shown before 😀. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Ill have to let you know in a few days, cant tell so soon, it happens over a spread-out time period. Thnx for the advice, Ill give it a try!
@SpotifyCares No it literally just played right after it said enjoy your 30 min of ad free music, sorry don’t mean to complain 😂
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares Thank you very much! Keep up the good work
@SpotifyCares You didn't  put @449566 's song on her Spotify  page it's been a week
@SpotifyCares She's upset that it was put under that jules not hers
@SpotifyCares I hope  so🙇 it's been a week since her song was released  .
@SpotifyCares Her Spotify https://t.co/xeGpm5tTeM  and her song https://t.co/UCcmE3eXgf
@SpotifyCares i hate to be a bother but when will @449566 have her song eyes shut on her spotify list?
@SpotifyCares I hope so she's been  waiting  for awhile thank you ❤
@SpotifyCares trying to play track 13 from this album...  https://t.co/xGAiNifurQ
No 'Play' icon appears, but it does on other tracks on the album.
@SpotifyCares 🙁
@SpotifyCares Not to worry, it’s just a bit annoying. Thanks anyway.
@SpotifyCares W10, PC app version1.0.66.478.g1296534d. No issues other than spotify but I restarted my PC and it fixed so thanks 4w/e you did from afar xD
@SpotifyCares I may be in Malaysia but that DOES NOT implies that I WANT malay as my language
@SpotifyCares Oh my god this is so terrible. Must come back.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Is it something that might be available in the future?
@SpotifyCares Yikes! Not much interest yet. I better spread the word!
@SpotifyCares That's it. Thanks for you time!
@SpotifyCares And I love the feature on my other devices! Which is why I want it on more! :P thanks again!
@SpotifyCares I'll check on my computer when I have a minute. Maybe my phone's just bring fussy. (Also idk how to clear that on my phone's browser)
@SpotifyCares Error 404????? Lol
@SpotifyCares It's been like this for weeks I'm afraid but I'll try again :)
@SpotifyCares Nothing I'm afraid 😔
@SpotifyCares NONE of my local files will download, i redownloaded the app and the desktop and now my old local files won't redownload to the app either https://t.co/aqAuVXF3yQ
@SpotifyCares nope, didn't work
@SpotifyCares I went to listen to music on the train and about 90% of the albums I'd downloaded weren't downloaded anymore. Also (1/)
@SpotifyCares ...several albums only had 2 or 3 tracks downloaded and the rest not. (2/2)
@SpotifyCares This is on a Samsung S8+, by the way. I'm not sure if there's some overly-aggressive cleanup process that runs on this phone perhaps?
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the link but I don't think any of those situations apply to me.
@SpotifyCares Hi, thanks. I hate the band Modest Mouse and they keep showing up on my Spotify playlists. Please make it stop
@SpotifyCares My account is set to Australia I love u.
@SpotifyCares Thank you 😊
@SpotifyCares i already saw that. “We’ve taken this decision as it currently has a very low engagement rate.” THEN FUCKING TELL PEOPLE. i found it accidentally and no one else i ever showed it to had heard of it before. taking away functionality cuz of poor communication is absurd
@SpotifyCares do you actually understand? doing customer support of twitter only makes ppl like you if they feel that they won’t be ignored. if you’re working on new functionality for press &amp; hold why take it out before you have the new functionality in there?
@SpotifyCares I want to subscribe to that ₱9 3 months premium, can you help me how?
@SpotifyCares @451295 Sooo no?
@SpotifyCares Let me know when those premium offers happen. For now I'll continue to work with your business model by making new accounts every time you have a promo.
@SpotifyCares Omigosh thank you so much for your concern, but there has been no login confusion thus far. I'm one of those broke millennials you talk crap about in your commercials. Your business model is flawed, but I found a way to work within it.
@SpotifyCares Hi! Yes, this is what it says when I try to redeem the code/accept the invitation through email. https://t.co/VewdiTjJq7
@SpotifyCares Hi, it didnt work
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the help, I appreciate it. I'll let you know how I get on.
@SpotifyCares like david bowie type? 80s rock? the clash, reo speedwagon, the romantics, starship, the psychedelic furs, etc.
@SpotifyCares thank u kings
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8 (running on iOS 11.1.1), app version 8.4.27, and Spotify Music app is the one I’m using.
@SpotifyCares If I reinstall will I have to download all my songs again?
@SpotifyCares Yes. But only because you’re so much better than @115948
@SpotifyCares I updated my app on and iOS Monday and it began then.
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.2 (beta) spotify 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares Thank you!! I hate apple music and iTunes, but they have a built-in visualizer that I love. Do it better 👏🏻
@SpotifyCares That post is from 5 years ago, and I already voted for this 2 years ago. Doesn’t feel like anything is changing.
@SpotifyCares thanks bae
@SpotifyCares ITS BEEN OVER A YEAR AGO COME ON
@SpotifyCares Ah, but you answered the wrong question! I know it’s not possible. What’s baffling is why :)
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares Okay, that sounds awesome! I was only asking because the page was asking me to enter credit card info, is that normal?
@SpotifyCares DM Sent
@SpotifyCares songs from the Cro-Mags album Alpha Omega are missing
@SpotifyCares Voted! Strange because @115821 said publicly on Sept 29 that @115888 support was coming soon, but Spotify has been 100% mums-the-word
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 plus, ios 11.1, spotify 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares It seems to work now but its when it doesn’t that is the issue
@SpotifyCares It's *their (majid Jordan is a duo)
@SpotifyCares Is Spotify not available in India? I'm from Malaysia and is currently studying in India. I can't gain access to my account here
@SpotifyCares Hoping for a launch soon! Or else I'll be in a real depression for the whole duration
@SpotifyCares Nothing to do w/ my account specifically. Same for my friends. Whoever went for Spotify Premium had a 7d trial only. (Germany)
@SpotifyCares Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I've already subscribed.
@SpotifyCares Nah that’s cool. Had Spotify since it started and this has been my only issue. If this gets resolved, all will be right with the world again
@SpotifyCares No error message, just that song is not available. On Samsung Galaxy 8+ Android 7.0 Spotify 8.4.22.857 armv7 on forum a few posts today
@SpotifyCares It dont know why it is not working https://t.co/MeBeWMI8DI
@SpotifyCares I did already and it‘s still not working.. I also deleted the app and downloaded it again but it still doesnt play the songs..
@SpotifyCares Specifically, "Allow site to play protected content" is not an option under Chrome 52.0 settings.
@SpotifyCares Using OSX El Capitan 10.11. Chrome 52.0. It's a multi-user computer, so sadly I don't have administrator rights. That will probably limit me
@SpotifyCares ..."Allow site to play protected content". However this setting doesn't exist, nor does its subheading of "Protected Content".
@SpotifyCares It's okay. I already figured it out
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares yes
@SpotifyCares PC version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
It’s done it 4/5 times in 2 days. thx.
@SpotifyCares 😑
@SpotifyCares Restarted, set up iphone new, tried all and everything, but no results...
@SpotifyCares Done that as well, even reinstalled with different app accounts and users
@SpotifyCares It never showed up, only on different accounts....compared all...all settings the same...still not working
@SpotifyCares Did u get the pn?
@SpotifyCares Ok, 2018 Skoda Kodiaq, Columbus Big Navi, CarPlay
@SpotifyCares Nope, just clicking on it does nothing. No redirects, errors, nothing..
@SpotifyCares Just did, still the same
@SpotifyCares Tried on mobile, doesn't work either. Don't have any other device at hand atm.
@SpotifyCares Thank you! ❄️🎅🏼☃️
@SpotifyCares Congratulations you’re about to join the family plan of... and it’s one of their names, not mine
@SpotifyCares its happening over 4G and WiFi, noticeably worse on wifi..it also affects my laptop and tablet versions of spoitfy :(
@SpotifyCares No error message, just constant crashing and freezing, music keeps playing and stopping randomly, shuffle doesn't work and superslow loading
@SpotifyCares I've been having issues for the past six months and I keep hitting brick walls with help :(
@SpotifyCares i tried it. no solution
@SpotifyCares i fixed the problem. i had not to include spotify app in the closed apps after lockscreen
@SpotifyCares Software version 8.4.20.535 I am pretty sure it has never worked properly, but I may have gotten more mixes lately. They just don’t refresh.
@SpotifyCares If you read all those posts I linked, you'll have plenty of examples. Personally, Chrome, Win10.
@SpotifyCares Idk the version of spotify.... my device is a samsung galaxy jmax tablet and android OS
@SpotifyCares Android version is 5.1.1
@SpotifyCares Thats the thing, it wont let me login. I tried restarting and it worked! Thanks ❤
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you 🙂
@SpotifyCares Problem solved by logging off on my devices
@SpotifyCares I sent you a dm
@SpotifyCares I got kicked off of my own account &amp; cant log back in &amp; y’all are still charging me for premium but I can’t even use it😪😪
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/HwZNhWVeY4
@SpotifyCares Laptop, W11, I had to uninstall the damn app...
@SpotifyCares Don't worry, Spotify is gone for good from my laptop...
@SpotifyCares Sorry, this is on Sierra, not High Sierra.  Haven't tested on the latter.
@SpotifyCares It seems odd that every other song from that album is there except for her debut single.
@SpotifyCares Update: It started working immediately after I tweeted this. 🙌
@SpotifyCares It did this time! Thanks.
@SpotifyCares ...Aaaaaand, as happens so often, search stopped working after just a few minutes. Argh. Now nothing happens, not even an error mesage.
@SpotifyCares The email i used for Facebook was __email__
@SpotifyCares results suck. ex: I search for "my romance" - select songs, because i only want to see songs with that search term 1/
@SpotifyCares get about 20 results for "my romance" in songs, but 100+ results for "my chemical romance" in band name. I didnt want to search band name 2/
@SpotifyCares that's what i did.
@SpotifyCares I have tried both ways.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/w0qGDtYFsd
@SpotifyCares I have done them all. And still nothing works.
@SpotifyCares Saudi Arabia.
@SpotifyCares I have lots of relatives who live in Saudi Arabia also and they were able to create their accounts.
@SpotifyCares Thank you.
@SpotifyCares hello help!
Yes I have been trying to sign up as a new user. And it won't let me.
As I said, it says an unknown error occurred
@SpotifyCares Thank you. Much appreciated. Didn't realise I could cut and paste. That helps somewhat. Hopefully it'll be an added feature in the future :)
@SpotifyCares Hi @SpotifyCares, been looking everywhere for your 2017 Media Kit, and Sales Rep Contact Number all over your sites, and forum. No Luck.
@SpotifyCares And *when* will you give us users the option not to play explicit tracks... They are tagged so should be that hard!
@SpotifyCares I’m on iPhone 7 Plus. When I close the app by accident it starts the song all over but when I close the app and then come back later...
@SpotifyCares It doesn’t start over, it just starts where it’s at. I know that’s probably something you can’t fix but I complain too much. 😂
@SpotifyCares Hi, it happens on my PC and phone. Phone is a Galaxy S7
@SpotifyCares I've tried this but unfortunately had no effect
@SpotifyCares @13281 @115888 What gets me is that folks who contributed to the algorithms you are using literally and personally know what music I like.
@SpotifyCares @13281 @115888 "Oh, you like experimental music, Andean folklorica, and early piedmont blues? Here's The Red Hot Chilli Peppers."
@SpotifyCares I don't think it could be more different than my mp3 and record collection. @13281 used to love me, but @115888 just laughs in my face heh
@SpotifyCares It doesn't seem to! It's hell bent on skewing whenever I, say, play something terrible to prove a point.
@SpotifyCares And now I'm at home, when I click the button, nothing happens
@SpotifyCares The only reason I pay for spotify is so I can listen to music offline, e.g. on the tube
@SpotifyCares I already did save the full album, so why did you delete it?
@SpotifyCares Just responded
@SpotifyCares one more question, @SpotifyCares when i used to use the share function to twitter a cool album art used to come up with a hashtag etc. Now we just get a long gnarly hyperlink...what gives?
@SpotifyCares Sharing from iPad or iPhone iOS 11.1.2 using Spotify app share feature
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/RzO5NtOjHM
@SpotifyCares No errors! In the car the phone is connected via Bluetooth and back home the phone or iPad is connected via WiFi to the a/v network receiver
@SpotifyCares Since the update to iOS 11.1 the problem is back again :-(
@SpotifyCares Good to know. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Is this because of the student account or did something just go wrong?
@SpotifyCares Wicked!! Do you want it DM'd? It never did it before my phone was repaired and reset 😭😭
@SpotifyCares Its on a macbook pro with Sierra and the most recent spotify update
@SpotifyCares Already did no help all my songs from my library are gone
@SpotifyCares So I have to make a new account if I want a different username?
@SpotifyCares Thx! Hope you fix it, or at least give users the option to choose what kind of media they want to see in their "Top Recommendations."
@SpotifyCares thanks!!
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I am using macOS 10.13 w/ Spotify 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 

All artists are working, only Pearl Jam not... 😞
@SpotifyCares It didn't solve, but also my iOS device isn't playing Pearl Jam too. They are one of my favorite bands, so please look into that.
@SpotifyCares It seems a lot of people have this issue and it's affecting the most listened band of each one, https://t.co/0JOokwHJVa
@SpotifyCares iOS on an iPhone 5s. Thank you for the attention :)
@SpotifyCares okay thanks! :)
@SpotifyCares Thanks! https://t.co/1BvzI7NgKf
@SpotifyCares I have already applied for an internship in Boston.  I am just curious if I can do volunteer programming to show support @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares United Kingdom. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares My friend @60499 is having a problem activating her Premium purchase. Hope u can help her
@SpotifyCares And the predictive search is just terrible.  And since you can't choose if you are searching Track, Artist or Album ahead of time, it blows
@SpotifyCares @24563 @59844 @59845 Yes... Thank you 😉
@SpotifyCares Ok no worries, is it integrated with any smart watch devices?
@SpotifyCares Does it work on Fit but devices then? I couldn't find if it does or on the link you sent me thank you
@SpotifyCares I have a galaxy s8, and the most up to date version of Spotify from google play.
@SpotifyCares Spotify deleted my mom and brother from my family account.
@SpotifyCares __email__ &amp; __email__
@SpotifyCares But no longer want them downloaded, the the iPhone app insisting on downloading all 8000 tracks
@SpotifyCares Thank you very much...
@SpotifyCares Doesn't go back far enough and is device specific which is even more frustrating
@SpotifyCares So part of your free service is that when you get to the end of a song, the app intentionally sits there and does nothing until you hit the skip button to play the next song, and after you've done this a number of times, you just can no longer listen to anything?
@SpotifyCares Spotify App Version 8.4.26.770, on a Samsung galaxy S7 with Android 7.0
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Voted for it years ago, it’s the reason I left Spotify for Apple Music. It’s the 4th top idea and has been ignored. What’s the point?
@SpotifyCares All done with Jerry S. On your chat line. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Good looks
@SpotifyCares Hey, thanks for the prompt reply. It's happened on the most recent iOS and my Mac Desktop version. I've noticed it at random over past 4/mos
@SpotifyCares No error messages. It happens after returning to a session when connecting to Bluetooth on mobile, &amp; at random when returning to play on Mac
@SpotifyCares Feeling a bit redundant here. The most up to date version for OSX and iOS
@SpotifyCares Been there. Done that. No resolve. Hence my outreach for suggested next steps or known bugs related to the issues. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Wow that's super disappointing that's not feature you have and people actually have to beg for it, back to Pandora it is
@SpotifyCares Solicito recibos Septiembre y Octubre 2017, __email__
Pueden mandarlo automáticamente cada mes, gracias.
@SpotifyCares Must have happened within the last week or so? I only noticed in the last few days
@SpotifyCares This happens with both my iPad (iOS 11.0.2) &amp; Android phone (7.1.1) running latest vers of Spotify using Chromecast 2 https://t.co/QMd11sXGH5
@SpotifyCares okay then, I'd paid 1 month premium account via mandiri clickpay but it doesn't make me premium member.
@SpotifyCares This did work, thank you
@SpotifyCares All good! Just updated my IOS and it now works. Thanks for the quick response :-)
@SpotifyCares K so here's pt.1 of where you got me hecked up there used to be a way to get to all the playlist you make. You know? On the errything else📱💻 https://t.co/O8aSdeFD4M
@SpotifyCares Then here's pt.2 my dude, there's A PERFECTLY GOOD SPOT HERE TO GET TO PLAYLISTS! I don't kno if it's a lot 2 ask 4 a few buttons but.. https://t.co/2IbbITGdaV
@SpotifyCares That's almost 2 years old and is followed by over a hundred pages of other people making the same complaints as me. How does this help me?
@SpotifyCares Well the thread has been up for close to 2 years and this seems like a relatively simple issue. I guess I can just switch to Google Music.
@SpotifyCares It will take all of one artist and not start it until toward the end of the shuffle every time. Is there a way to make it simply random?
@SpotifyCares ...to fast forward or rewind the song.
@SpotifyCares I have an iPhone 6, with iOS 11.0.2 software. The version of Spotify I have is 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares Looks like that worked! Thank you 🙏
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I've done what you suggested and it seems alright for now. Will update you guys again if anything goes wrong.
@SpotifyCares Hey Spotify, this is happening again. I can't possibly be logging in and out / restarting each time this happens? :(
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Huawei P9, Android OS, app ver 8.4.18.743. My headphones are Avantree Audition Bluetooth 4.0 headphones.
@SpotifyCares I’m using an iPhone 6s&amp;it’s your most current version :/ like when you click to listen to a song,it won’t let you&amp;wants to shuffle play 🙄 https://t.co/TM1pbC8ven
@SpotifyCares Everything is fine! Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Please try and get him to sign with y’all
@SpotifyCares Jay Z is the goat of rap. Better than 2Pac
@SpotifyCares Sure, it’s Spotify 8.4.25.906 on iOS 11.0.3. Not a new issue though, followed me through several updates.
@SpotifyCares Most likely __email__
@SpotifyCares Bless u partner
@SpotifyCares Playlists we want to transfer to one of the family accounts and then remove from source acct.
@SpotifyCares i just got the new iphone update and i have premium
@SpotifyCares Maybe I just don't know myself... Oh god, I didn't want to find out this way!
@SpotifyCares @9756 @60948 @462659 Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Brill thanks very much
@SpotifyCares Hi! I think there must’ve been a gremlin in my phone, because it’s now playing correctly, it definitely wasn’t before! No need to worry 🙈👹
@SpotifyCares Ah ok so it’s been redesigned for the notch in the X?
@SpotifyCares Do we know when they’ll optimise the app to take advantage of the new screen layout? Cause it’s super blocky
@SpotifyCares I'm a subscriber to Family premium, but others can't access the account for some reason. Can you DM for assistance please?
@SpotifyCares I have saved a bunch of songs on my songs category and next thing you know they disappear
@SpotifyCares The normal 3 state is a 2 state on these devices: no repeat and repeat all
@SpotifyCares I have an idea: I think this only happens when I listen via an Amazon Echo. Can it be you don't allow repeat one there?
@SpotifyCares Not any voice command, just the app given, to set a song played in a record to "repeat one". See yourself: https://t.co/vUQ2hnfwQY
@SpotifyCares Nope, no change. But when I switch from Alexa as a speaker to my iPhone as a speaker, the 3 state works. Definite Alexa problem.
@SpotifyCares My Alexa is on version 591448720. This is the latest version. I understand Alexa updates are provided automatically.
@SpotifyCares spotify version is 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 - using it from Desktop, Windows 10
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/hD4q6KzizS
@SpotifyCares @463557 No such problems with @115948 Ali 😉 Currently 6829 songs on my phone.
@SpotifyCares Help! I need to delete my Facebook linked account . I log in and it reactivates my Facebook 🤦🏽‍♀️
@SpotifyCares Sure. Win 10 pro. Spotify version 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares Done. When logged out CPU is nearly 0%. As soon as I log in its back to 20-23%. Maybe the animated advertising needs it?
@SpotifyCares Thanks anyways. No I just recognized the fan getting louder and louder although I didn't do anything special. So I checked CPU ...
@SpotifyCares Done. Same. I think I found it. When I am on the home screen with the large animated ads the CPU jumps. CPU is ok when in daily mix view.
@SpotifyCares well it seems it never ends .. stays on screen and keeps moving.
@SpotifyCares there is no such button ?
@SpotifyCares Also happen on my Android phone. Pls HELP. https://t.co/3lG3S9DBUj
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s, latest iOS software and latest Spotify update too
@SpotifyCares I uninstalled and reinstalled yesterday cos was crashing. Hard restated iPhone twice also cos had problems. Could be my phone not SpotifyApp
@SpotifyCares Is it something others have mentioned too then? Not just my phone playing up?
@SpotifyCares Thank You,Its been fixed,Again Thank you 🙏
@SpotifyCares It's ok.. I'm planning to renew my premium a few month from now
@SpotifyCares Okay💕
@SpotifyCares yeah but i dont wanna give out my credit card number bro
@SpotifyCares It still asks for a card though,, and I don't have a card.
@SpotifyCares I was able to fix it. Just deleted app and downloaded it again. Thank you anyways
@SpotifyCares Hi, I'm on a Toshiba using Windows 7. I uninstalled Spotify but now it won't reinstall, telling me "Spotify Could not be opened Error C 17"
@SpotifyCares Same thing happened.
@SpotifyCares It kept saying something was wrong with my card and kept having me re enter it. Now I have 6 diff charges on my account
@SpotifyCares then what is the download songs feature for???
@SpotifyCares i thank you
@SpotifyCares Thanks an easy tweak - add “undo” button or bar in general area.  Thanks guys!
@SpotifyCares Never mind, I see it in play queue.  As interface feedback there should be a direct action to recover...  Confusing.
@SpotifyCares Omg I was just being dramatic it didn’t come out till midnight.... love you spotify thanks for caring ❤️
@SpotifyCares That would be nice. I'm using Spotify in Japan, if that helps, so you can let them know it's super pointless.
@SpotifyCares @465543 Way to ruin it. Why would I want more artist on my artist playlist. Kesha playing on my danny elfman come on. Pandora it is then
@SpotifyCares The 1% bit is a bit insulting. What features are actually happening that the 99% are voting on?

The limit seems so arbitrary.
@SpotifyCares Hi! Thank you so much. It's been so stressful. Here's the 1st one: https://t.co/025vTKrZS8 and 2nd one: https://t.co/ErhKxbHlB0
@SpotifyCares thanks! just contacted now.
@SpotifyCares Guten Morgen,Und wo haben sie da geantwortet..Ich habe KEINE Rückerstattung erhalten!!Oder Feedback darüber..BIN immer noch Student.mfg

Bitte um Feedback Kai
@SpotifyCares Awesome!
@SpotifyCares I finally fixed it by installing from the win10 app store ...
@SpotifyCares Yes thank you
@SpotifyCares Do you know when  lovelyz and infinite company is gonna put  thier music back on  spotify and twice and got7 back in spotify
@SpotifyCares Lg k20 plus. Nougat 7.1.  Spotify version 8.4.23.784 armv7
@SpotifyCares fix this
@SpotifyCares @115888 Thank you but the thing is this IS the explicit version. Do you have a policy against phrases about guns?
@SpotifyCares Idk how to check which country it’s set at
@SpotifyCares And I'm on Spotify Version 8.4.28
@SpotifyCares i will sorry for bothering
@SpotifyCares i don't have enough money :((
@SpotifyCares Will do!
@SpotifyCares version 8.4.25
@SpotifyCares It works when I restart my device but it stops working after awhile. I keep having to restart my device whenever it happens
@SpotifyCares I did that and it happened again
@SpotifyCares And that is the annoying part. I thought this was supposed to be a seamless experience.
@SpotifyCares No. What I do is log out of Spotify &amp; log in thru Facebook. Works fine until I use Spotify in another device, so I go through it all again.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s Plus, iOS 11.1, ver. 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares The ready-made applet works with @29961 sheets. I had to double check the connection to that service before it worked. I made a zap on @90313 , and the zap returned everything in order. But I quickly face the problem of pricing. @90313 is too expensive for this task.
@SpotifyCares DMed details. Today I have discovered the european player @466610 that looks promising. But I need some code to get everything to work as in zapier and ifttt. I'm looking for answers.
@SpotifyCares Please answer my DM!
@SpotifyCares The only clickable option was “Turn off auto-renew” NOTHING about cancelling my subscription, so PLEASE help me cancel my subscription, this is really ticking me off.
@SpotifyCares the overlay is nice, but it sticks around for long enough to get in the way of things
@SpotifyCares I know but they never answer
@SpotifyCares And i don't have any problem with spotify on my laptop &amp; iPad, just on my phone
@SpotifyCares No probs, thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the response! I appreciate you passing on the message.
@SpotifyCares Are there any plans to up this? I wouldn’t mind paying more per month to have more space…
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Google pixel, Android v8.0 
Spotify: 8.4.22.857 armV7 

Think it broke with recent Android update. 

Thanks
@SpotifyCares I’m in the United States.
@SpotifyCares I get a 301 redirect to https://t.co/A8XqleIprT from https://t.co/smcWK7Ldkg and https://t.co/MsFYFDS0SG, Accept-Language: en-us, in France
@SpotifyCares Safari TP
@SpotifyCares Don't worry, it's come through
@SpotifyCares It's called Young Sinatra
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/z6hhRCZqwq is the home page. It's just the web-player, I have no idea where it would say where the version is
@SpotifyCares I've tried this and it still does not work.
@SpotifyCares It appears to be a problem with my profile, because I've just created a new profile now and that's working.
@SpotifyCares @61898 Hi! The album Sound of a Million Dreams from David Nail has 11 tracks, but my app only shows 3 tracks.
@SpotifyCares It’s been pretty bad for months now :( that would be awesome though, thank you!!
@SpotifyCares PLEASE let us downvote discover tracks. Please. I beg of you. I can't take this
@SpotifyCares Your app asked to pick a username at sign up (android).. Nowhere in the app is a place to set display name. https://t.co/HpOPbdC4nU
@SpotifyCares Well it should be what i (self) sees in the app aswell. Very confusing.
@SpotifyCares Thank you.
@SpotifyCares It’s definitely needed. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Removed and reinstalled. Issue is now resolve
@SpotifyCares thanks. Only thing I’m waiting for is Spotify working / playing on all my amazon echos at once. -‘everywhere’  :-)
@SpotifyCares Also, the "Explicit button" doesn't solve my problem. I want to be able to play all clean versions, not skip over them.
@SpotifyCares Not working tried on chrome &amp; safari both on mobile &amp; laptop :|
@SpotifyCares Just a way too long loading page
@SpotifyCares It’s __email__
@SpotifyCares Hi Ma'am/Sir. From the app :)
@SpotifyCares Done
@SpotifyCares Thx! Appreciate it. I left a comment in the thread there but do you think this will actually change? The artists deserve the credit
@SpotifyCares I’d like to continue here
@SpotifyCares Well there are some songs in my playlists it just randomly skips, I can’t recognise a particular pattern there. I haven’t tried restarting.
@SpotifyCares The issue has been resolved, thanks!
@SpotifyCares The words subscriptions use-but you are better..App’s cache, means you can/can’t download an album to, say flash drive or external drive/CD
@SpotifyCares @AppleSupport BTW, thanks Spotify. Responded to problem asked about. I’ve searched Apple issue on support/Blogs/online &amp; feels as if problem is avoided
@SpotifyCares @AppleSupport No Spotify-My iPad Pro has NO “iCloud Music Library” option(AP Ans-Turn on/off will show up)
Turn ON/OFF what’s not there/see.
@SpotifyCares any browser over wifi; when I try over 4G I can get to the site but can't add family members: https://t.co/EvgHZLFXmr
@SpotifyCares Songs I️ download online
@SpotifyCares Understandable. For someone like me, however, who loves them as well as many other artists who are on my daily rotation, chances are still slim to none that i even get an email.
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks, I will give it a go.
@SpotifyCares 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares 1/ No, so you know how you can click and drag a song to move it around on a playlist? It won't drag for this specific playlist.
@SpotifyCares 2/ It just looks like this: https://t.co/dVn5zJLhv4
@SpotifyCares 3/ Kind of hard to get a screenshot to demonstrate. It just doesn't move at all, doesn't show the green bar to show where it's moving to..
@SpotifyCares 4/ Here's a link to the playlist if that helps? https://t.co/zNKsOBuRo7
@SpotifyCares Hmm. I don't think any were on, but me messing around with it somehow fixed it. Thanks!!
@SpotifyCares 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 and High Sierra. I can no longer browse devices (Sonos doesn't show, either does my PS4, not that I use it). Thanks btw
@SpotifyCares Sure. Will try. Not sure if relevant but I recently connected some bluetooth headphones (which still work fine). Bug maybe?
@SpotifyCares I don’t have the disconnect option from social media
@SpotifyCares Need support ASAP!!!
@SpotifyCares I have a USA account. The link isn't on Spotify anymore since a few weeks ago. Here's the URL https://t.co/BzGVJ8susw
@SpotifyCares android 7.0 on a moto g4 with spotify 8.4.25.771armV7. spotify will randomly delete all saved music.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/HOs5Wn49XJ
@SpotifyCares iMac OSX Sierra and latest Spotify. When my playlist finishes it keeps playing a band I don’t like so I downvote and they keep playing :(
@SpotifyCares Frequently freezes mid-song. Sometimes for a few seconds, Sometimes for as long as a minute. Pause and play commands take up to 40 secs
@SpotifyCares Thank you very much @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6, 11.0.3 iPhone version and 8.4.25 Spotify version
@SpotifyCares It’s working again.
@SpotifyCares that fixed it! Cheers for that! :)
@SpotifyCares just one more question, I have 2GB data monthly plan, will that be enough for listening spotify or will spotify eat through it quickly? 🤔
@SpotifyCares Many thanks
@SpotifyCares Not sure to be honest. No other issues with Spotify though at all.
@SpotifyCares Strange. Just certain artists I've followed, I go back to their page and the button has reverted back to 'follow'. Nothing major 😊
@SpotifyCares well i mean i just installed it like yesterday! But ok I will try
@SpotifyCares already been played for only 8-10seconds
@SpotifyCares It works fine after I restart the app but I mean... I shouldn't have to do that every time haha n also it won't then play the ones that have
@SpotifyCares Basically most of the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack 😬 https://t.co/rCE21Y29QU
@SpotifyCares USA
@SpotifyCares Thank you! And well in that case also please add support up to 5 offline device for Premium users :)
@SpotifyCares @125633 I went through @137960 &amp; I just would like my email and password for artist account emailed to me please😫
@SpotifyCares I️ replied last night and haven’t heard back. ☹️
@SpotifyCares Woo I'm glad it's on your "radar" 😉. I hope you can make it happen. +1 from me!
@SpotifyCares Nope, just create a copy for the same account in the same place.
@SpotifyCares Muchas gracias!
@SpotifyCares I logged out and logged back in and it shows up now thank you
@SpotifyCares When i try to listen to his album the songs dont show up https://t.co/RzZi1Ud8vp
@SpotifyCares @125633 Awesome. Thank you guys. You guys took care of it for me yesterday 😉😉Really appreciate it the swift response.
@SpotifyCares Just trying to be funny - I don’t really hate you guys but wow! That was a lot of hoops to jump through to close an account!!
@SpotifyCares Ayyy
@SpotifyCares Mobile and Desktop app
@SpotifyCares Is this something that will be fixed shortly? I like seeing when exactly in the year things were released
@SpotifyCares So you givin me a "case closed" link 😆, just add an equalizer already...there's one for cellphone, i know it.
@SpotifyCares Oh boy is it ever! The Windows 10 Mobile app is a #disasterpiece. I like #spotify, but not on #W10M. #toBeContinued https://t.co/kSXkQTAowv
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply, But is this saying can't shuffle at all now? lol I'm doing it on my current playlist.
@SpotifyCares Oh, okay. Thanks :(
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your help KP :)) . Please find my artist song, can you please help get into a playlist ? https://t.co/XvPAHe0axQ A MILLION THANKS
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares @XboxSupport If it makes a difference I'm on insider beta ring
@SpotifyCares what
@SpotifyCares Ok, thanks for the reply. Have a great weekend!
@SpotifyCares The mixtape explanation helps a little. You have two of his mixtapes available, does this mean he would need submit the rest of his mixtapes
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares I saved the song Gummo by 6ix9ine yesterday and it played, but for some reason it's not playing now. What's going on?
@SpotifyCares Hey, I don't think it is device specific, it has happened on two different android devices. I'm talking about the offline mode in-app.
@SpotifyCares I usually download music and then go in offline mode but sometimes I get logged out &amp; the app won't let me log in, it thinks I am offline.
@SpotifyCares I (unfortunately) had to delete the local data, then logged in no problem thanks. I wasn't looking for assistance, I was reporting a bug :)
@SpotifyCares That was the exact thing you said to do last time. How often should I need to do this?
@SpotifyCares Ok. Hope you’re already working on it. Looks not so nice on iPhone X.
@SpotifyCares Thx so much!!!!
Fixed 🙏 🙏
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s+, 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares Yea Thank u for contacting and hoping to launch it in egypt soon 😢
@SpotifyCares Everything else connects through wi-fi so can’t check another Bluetooth device.
@SpotifyCares @472006 رحت اعيطلهن شويه وبتاع مكنتش متوقع يردو ، يارب يسمعو كلامي واكون سبب يشغلوه فمصر بقي قريب واشيل ذنوب كل الناس دي بقي 💙💙😂😂😂😂
@SpotifyCares I tested this last night, with the new device too; reformatted as portable, and I had the option, but prefer the internal format.
@SpotifyCares This only works if you format the SD card as "portable storage", which is how I have it on my phone, I opted for int fmt with my new device.
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares @129773 @15778 ...formatted as internal storage on Android? Thanks
@SpotifyCares Ermmm, just joking though.
@SpotifyCares No error message at all. Just this. https://t.co/rhOFARxYak
@SpotifyCares Tried that already. :( Happens at other locations.
@SpotifyCares Yes.
@SpotifyCares United States!
@SpotifyCares Sweeeet!
@SpotifyCares Thank you! 😌
@SpotifyCares Just sent a DM
@SpotifyCares Wasn't actually expecting a reply, nice. Thank you! :)
@SpotifyCares THANK U!!!! https://t.co/piw61R2YRa
@SpotifyCares You have had months prior to release of the phone to get this sorted!
@SpotifyCares thank you for clearing that up!
@SpotifyCares What's DM?
@SpotifyCares Oh, hang on... haven't logged out of Spotify app... Will try when back at desk tomorrow.
@SpotifyCares Thx. Is video banner ads under playlist / above controls (not overlay ads). Acer E1572P, Win10 all latest patches, v 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares @115888 Unable to pause or rightclick + report. Only to mute whole PC and wait. Super annoying!!
@SpotifyCares No profit
@SpotifyCares Best reply of today 💛
@SpotifyCares Well it stopped after I tweeted you...🤔🤔🤔
@SpotifyCares I shouldn't need to do that, i'm happy with the number i have
@SpotifyCares Sweet thanks
@SpotifyCares Fist bump x
@SpotifyCares ok thanks I'll try that 👍
@SpotifyCares iPhone SE, Spotify Version 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares iOS version 10.0.2
@SpotifyCares I updated this morning but it was occurring the night before.
@SpotifyCares Both
@SpotifyCares It worked 😤👌
@SpotifyCares Lmao nvm, still happening
@SpotifyCares Thanks im using an iPhone 6s, iOS, spotify version 6.0 but it's happening for a lot of us not just me so it may be an issue with Teen Party
@SpotifyCares Here's a screenshot of all the ppl it's happening to https://t.co/vnW5CA2uOe and it's only for that one song
@SpotifyCares There's nothing wrong with the song if you play it from the artist but clearly there is if you play it from the playlist
@SpotifyCares My premium account is not picking up rssss, sad!
@SpotifyCares Thanks but I'm certain that's not the case with all of these titles. To have rights to only half of a live album set makes no sense.
@SpotifyCares thanks. Iphone 7 OS 11.1 and not sure about Spotify, but updated today (no effect). Car is nissan leaf 2015. Usb connected
@SpotifyCares no, that does not help
@SpotifyCares hi, tried it but didn’t work. Could be issue with phone settings? I can’t get any audio from phone on car, not just spotify.
@SpotifyCares If only.
@SpotifyCares You could at least play suggested tracks from artists that I actually listen to. I do not wanna go from Chris Brown to Katy Perry 😒
@SpotifyCares Hey, it’s okay. I can’t reset my password via my email. It seems my email has been changed. My username is adi_kencana
@SpotifyCares thanks for caring !! Yes, I tried that too.. it starts with this view.... https://t.co/H4Mgvd7xTy https://t.co/UmGUuTV24U
@SpotifyCares nope. Logged in &amp; out and still is not going away https://t.co/kPERlORcLN
@SpotifyCares Whenever I tap on a song, nothing plays. No error message or anything
@SpotifyCares Today I upgraded to an iPhone X and iOS 11.1. Most recent version of Spotify. Just started happening today
@SpotifyCares Happens on both WiFi and 4G. As far as I can tell, this is the only album that is affected
@SpotifyCares Ah yes, link me to a thread where other people complain about the same thing, the ol community manager switcheroo
@SpotifyCares Thanks for sorting so quickly and the fast response 😊
@SpotifyCares well it appears it is the case as I tried resetting without the ? in the password and it works. This is not communicated at all on the site
@SpotifyCares Thank you also
@SpotifyCares Awwman😔you should definately bring this feature back and find a low maintenance way to
@SpotifyCares Oh good. Glad it was #fakenews then. Lol
@SpotifyCares Any updates? 🙂
@SpotifyCares I did try that with no luck. I followed this guide: https://t.co/6oiGOOeCna
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/W6WsrVj0T1
@SpotifyCares in the Spotify app on my iPhone SE running iOS 10
@SpotifyCares 2015 MacBook Pro running macOS 10.12.6. Spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02. It also happens on the web player in chrome and
@SpotifyCares other artists work fine, but those two do not for some reason.  What should I do?
@SpotifyCares Hi I️ got it fixed with your chat folks.  Thanks
@SpotifyCares i have three playlist by the way https://t.co/WChePA9bKn
@SpotifyCares Yeah no problem.
@SpotifyCares Username is kevingroenendaal. :)
@SpotifyCares It’s either Malaga or The Netherlands (29007, 1423EJ), because I moved this year.
@SpotifyCares O no worries, i found the song, was just wondering how come it wasn't on the list :-)
@SpotifyCares Ask and you shall receive. Thank you Spotify, I knew you cared 😎
@SpotifyCares Noted and voted. I still use the old Starred playlist as well so it’s not the end of the world.
@SpotifyCares But still, if a normal playlist can have over 10,000 songs, why can’t the Songs section do the same?
@SpotifyCares Hi, Win10 Pro version 1703, 64-bit, 8GB RAM, 3GHz CPU. Spotify version 1.0.66.478.g1296534d. Loader/spinner when loading playlists, home etc
@SpotifyCares Your forum mentions loads of other users experiencing same btw. Also, I have fiber internet 100mbit up/down. Cheers. https://t.co/YE4kD7ozwD
@SpotifyCares PS I also use iOS iPhone app &amp; that's perfect 💚
@SpotifyCares ?? I was giving you advice guys. I’m already premium. If this is how you guys look at innovation I’m worried. Greatest ideas come from below
@SpotifyCares Okay I'll give that a try. It doesn't happen all the time but often enough to annoy me. I'll report back in a few days. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Nope. That didn’t fix the issue. https://t.co/R6GpxAykT6
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 Plus Spotify version 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6 Plus. Spotify version 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares I’m on v8.4.25. I have an iPhone 7+ and on iOS 11.1 It freezes, I kill the app, re-open, it works long enough for me to play a song, freezes
@SpotifyCares It’s gone back to normal after about an hour of constantly freezing. If it freezes again, I’ll try that. Thanks for your help 😊
@SpotifyCares Voted and commented! Thank you for hearing me out!
@SpotifyCares thanks ily
@SpotifyCares Ok sure! Thanks for your quick response 😊 I love Spotify
@SpotifyCares LOL. props for the creativity, thanks guys !
@SpotifyCares All I had to do was refresh the tab. Thanks though!
@SpotifyCares Thanks! 😁
@SpotifyCares Hey yeah its october 16th and i got an ad from gwen stefani singing about gingerbread cookies
@SpotifyCares Thank you :)
@SpotifyCares This new @115858 update (iOS 11) won’t allow me to swipe up and change the song on spotfiy like I could before the update.
@SpotifyCares That was why! Thanks great CS
@SpotifyCares I updated my Spotify and the problem is solved. Thanks
@SpotifyCares it still doesn't work. Seems like it might be their problem but thanks anyway for your help and response.
@SpotifyCares @460325 Many thanks! Its __email__.
I received a 'confirm' email but could not make it work. Best wishes Richard
@SpotifyCares Thank you! ~ https://t.co/ZnueRZ3H1b
@SpotifyCares Thanks, dad.
@SpotifyCares Wow! My account is in the US. And yes, I was thinking Winehouse, Adele, Kesha, Stevie Nicks, Aretha, etc. Feel free to spice it up. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Y'all are the best! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thank you it has stopped but scary someone can hack into my account
@SpotifyCares Also tried uninstalling/reinstalling on both.
@SpotifyCares Nope. iPhone happened on WiFi and LTE.
@SpotifyCares Wrong: spotify:artist:3LJdcfPLUXngXgiOTkxMjn
True: spotify:artist:7vk5e3vY1uw9plTHJAMwjN
@SpotifyCares I shall drop you a DM in a bit. Seems to be happening to others though looking online and the Spotify forum thingy!
@SpotifyCares Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Yeah, I noticed. However, the "overall Spotify experience" doesn't help me let my kids find and play music without a phone.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/1grwJT22Yz
@SpotifyCares Thanks! You are the best!
@SpotifyCares Guys, I'm talking about He Like That and not about Can You See
@SpotifyCares I just don't understand the point. I was obviously kidding about Limewire - but why the limit? Who is it hurting?
@SpotifyCares Thanks I figured it out.
@SpotifyCares There is no menu on the left.....still confused
@SpotifyCares Will try again ty
@SpotifyCares __email__, ty
@SpotifyCares Ok I guess I don't want this app then
@SpotifyCares i think that did the job. if it didn't i'll get back to you. thanks! 🙃
@SpotifyCares Wait what? Lol
@SpotifyCares Just tested - both. Also just tweeted  the below and doesn't play if I click on it. 

https://t.co/KkpFVTiXTn
@SpotifyCares No Twitter on other devices sorry.
@SpotifyCares The issue is within the Twitter app.
@SpotifyCares Only when it's been shared on Twitter - tried w a couple others over the last week and same result - just this screen buffering https://t.co/Y2KxF3qqzL
@SpotifyCares Pixel 1- Android 8.0.0 - thanks 🙂 https://t.co/rFJ1XCB651
@SpotifyCares No it just doesn’t fit the entire screen of the X. There are black bars on the top and bottom.
@SpotifyCares I just un-downloaded it and then re downloaded it, it’s fine now. Thanks though
@SpotifyCares All of them!
@SpotifyCares Samsung s7, Android 7, and the latest Spotify version.
@SpotifyCares I'm thankful that you care 🙏
@SpotifyCares Not on the PlayStation... It's literally giving me an error.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/ju2qDjfWiv
@SpotifyCares It sees my nvidia shield on the same network and wants to stream to the tv. Can’t turn it off
@SpotifyCares Latest on iOS 11. Literally just installed it
@SpotifyCares Didn’t try the website will let you know
@SpotifyCares Thanks guys. Excellent CS
@SpotifyCares That fixed it! Thanks guys!
@SpotifyCares @478434 Can I also be contacted? Thanks.
@SpotifyCares No, can’t see through other devices. Tried my phone as well. The playlists are all gone but I could go to the website and reset them. Weird.
@SpotifyCares You took Offset album away from me 😭
@SpotifyCares i have an iPhone 6! It's working now, thank you :)
@SpotifyCares i'm on iOS 10.3.3 and version 8.4.23! :)
@SpotifyCares my downloaded songs
@SpotifyCares hi, the song just keeps cutting off, every couple of seconds it just pauses itself
@SpotifyCares Thanks!.
@SpotifyCares number #2, the only song who redirect to another new profile... 
https://t.co/8zQmpalmTQ
@SpotifyCares any chance to put this song on the official artist's page/profile?
@SpotifyCares HERE ➡️ spotify:artist:3qNVuliS40BLgXGxhdBdqu
@SpotifyCares thanks to you, as expected from spotify support 👍🏻
I hope it is resolved soon
@SpotifyCares I just want to make playlists and chill downtown, that’s not a category....
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 11.1
@SpotifyCares No it doesn’t. have the most recent update and premium
@SpotifyCares Nothing happened
@SpotifyCares False news, y’all have tons of grease slick songs but not the best one.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! The old app build had a separate design optimised for larger screens. You should really bring it back.
@SpotifyCares Spotify 8.4.25.771 armv7

I'm hitting share via SMS, which inputs "Here's a song for you.. (long song link)"
@SpotifyCares Shared it to SMS. It's over 140 characters.
@SpotifyCares Copy link+pasting works.
@SpotifyCares Thank you, top quality service as normal. Have both voted and commented.
@SpotifyCares This is the most recent version from the App Store. Update notes mention zero iPhone X compatibility changes. https://t.co/kBtQFR7yoa
@SpotifyCares I didnt get any error message, it just kick me out after login.
@SpotifyCares Thank you 🙌🏼❤️

@SpotifyCares Hi! Tried both things and didn't work. I just noticed that appears a small message: "Sorry, you can't give likes to this post.".
@SpotifyCares The problem was that I hadn't set a username for my account in the community. Now I'm able to vote. 👍
@SpotifyCares Yyyyeeeessssss!! 🎅🎅🤶🤶 https://t.co/y7umOFZ32Y

@SpotifyCares Tried that. Now it's completely broken. Spotify is set as default music service in Assistant. https://t.co/5VHiOkPAfj
@SpotifyCares Yes, I did that. Unlinked and then linked again. Not working at all now.
@SpotifyCares It's not your fault. I'm really happy with my Spotify subscription. This is probably just between me and Everclear.
@SpotifyCares This helps me personally, but doesn't solve the larger problem.
@SpotifyCares Xperia M C1905, Android 4.3, Spotify Version 8.4.23.784 armV7
@SpotifyCares I think it affects those tracks from the artists too
@SpotifyCares I don't try those steps yet. the thing is I can't even play the track both on my phone and desktop.
@SpotifyCares the song is available but i can't play it, perhaps the publisher didn't put the songs there... there's no error message in my phone though https://t.co/LYmD3X3l7Z
@SpotifyCares I tap on the tracks on my S7, and the songs just won't play, on my laptop, it says, the song isn't avalible.
@SpotifyCares @480812 Please dm me also
@SpotifyCares Not to be a dick, but I'm giving @SpotifyCares feedback here. Not going to post it twice: your current (new or otherwise) shuffle algorithm blows. I suggest a new name for the shuffle button, "repeat."
@SpotifyCares Awesome, thanks!
@SpotifyCares about this, that offer is for credit card, previous year is not, so many of spotify user(teenager&amp;student), esp in indonesia, really mad at this, bcs they don't have cc at their age https://t.co/5TrkUUCkRr
@SpotifyCares Thanks - you seem to have all other Morrissey content so fingers crossed won't be too hard to get hold of!!
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/N4usaH7QnC
@SpotifyCares My own playlist. The playlist itself hasn't been deleted.
@SpotifyCares 💚you care. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Are you using my music taste against me? Because I love it.
@SpotifyCares Alright thank you
@SpotifyCares It worked thanks
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7
@SpotifyCares I’m on iOS and I’m rocking the latest update
@SpotifyCares one of the songs that was put on spotify was completely changed.not just for me for my friends
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/MKv3qG1iyr
@SpotifyCares its supposed to sound like this https://t.co/h1mcmK6TAd
my phone and laptop both do the same thing. im not sure what version i have
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/UE7uRm5Uxl
@SpotifyCares thank you.
i am #blessed
@SpotifyCares Thanks &lt;3
@SpotifyCares Thanksss ❤️
@SpotifyCares Aw wow, you really do care. I'm touched.
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares it's randomly just stopping mid song till i close the app and re open and also making songs sound all sped up as if it's a weird remix lol
@SpotifyCares I'll try that next time it goes weird and will write back to here, it's doing ok just now. Thanks !
@SpotifyCares Majid Jordan @ The Wiltern in LA on 2/7/18
@SpotifyCares Wow tbh I'll cry if I don't receive an email bc I love them but ok 😭
Thank u for your help AR. You a real one. 💓
@SpotifyCares Using a Mac book pro Spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares No it Only happens on my Mac
@SpotifyCares Same result from both. It looks like it may actually be @120872 as per usual
@SpotifyCares iPhone X, iOS 11.1, Sonos Controller 8.1.1. 
Was happening on my iPhone 7 Plus also.
@SpotifyCares I spoke too soon!
@SpotifyCares Already done, just a bit baffled why this isn’t a standard option? With my kids around I can’t use #Spotify
@SpotifyCares This is real off point, not only does it look atrocious, the app doesn’t even work properly. Will be switching to Apple Music on Tuesday morning if there is no update by then.
@SpotifyCares well if u guys should try getting licensed before Feb-2018 as elections are coming in this country and due to that u guys might get accepted
@SpotifyCares so kindly add Pakistan in your launching country list as many people here wants @115888 here
@SpotifyCares Is it possible spotify did that themselves because it doesn’t seem like the artist would want it to be deleted himself
@SpotifyCares The song „Gummo“ from the artist 6ix9ine has been taken down from spotify when it was just available yesterday
@SpotifyCares I’m just talking about the interface.  The black bars.  Nearly every other app is optimized and fills the display
@SpotifyCares Thanks guys.  I’m just a little OCD about stuff like that.
@SpotifyCares Thanks - started working within an hour of my Tweet and had response from @137949 .   Thanks for response.
@SpotifyCares All seems to be fine now. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Alright thanks 😊 i wish it can be updated soon though ❤
@SpotifyCares Big thanks ❤💜
@SpotifyCares Hi, I used a laptop to get access from the web, but Safari on the iPhone wouldn't work either. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Have already tried that multiple times and have already tried reinstalling. It only happens when I try and play Drake
@SpotifyCares I can listen while playing through my phone speaker but once I connect to a device I can no longer listen to the playlist.
@SpotifyCares It tells me I can’t play the current track and I can import it if it is a local file. Latest version of Spotify on the latest version of win
@SpotifyCares Anytime I try to open it, it's not loading &amp; the 1 time it did, the music wouldn't play
@SpotifyCares I am using an iPhone 6s &amp; version 8.4.22 of Spotify
@SpotifyCares So far it seems to be working I'll try my Bluetooth again later, thanks so much!! 😊
@SpotifyCares It still doesn't play when I connect to my Bluetooth just for a few seconds then stops 😩
@SpotifyCares Yes ive just restarted and will wait to try again!
@SpotifyCares Didn't work 😓 I'll wait a few more days, but I might just cancel since I can't get it to work 💔 thanks again for helping!!
@SpotifyCares No I am not I double checked this morning but it's just Spotify
@SpotifyCares Eagerly looking forward to it! I had to give up your service when I moved here, and it changed my life for the worse 😢
@SpotifyCares Can’t wait for my next Discover Weekly 😉
@SpotifyCares Hi! I have another issue I just DMed
@SpotifyCares I finally made it work but I had tonuse several workaround.... i had to use a special webmail that shows the link to make it work
@SpotifyCares tried deleting it and redownloading it. IT DOESN’T WORK I JUST WANNA LISTEN @64397 SHOUT ABOUT VODKA IN A SPRITE CAN.
@SpotifyCares Oh, don't worry! It seems there is a problem with my bank Nationwide and most cards are getting declined on online payments. Thanks though!
@SpotifyCares Yeah I mean i like the 90s rock, but where is the 90s hip hop, metal, pop, etc? Same story for each decade station. Need more variety.
@SpotifyCares Thank you! Love your service btw
@SpotifyCares That's silly. There needs 2 B a way to remove a song when it plays. Searching thru playlists to find the song and delete is ridic. 9 clicks.
@SpotifyCares @484170 @13383 @64290 @64291 @64292 Will do! Thank you! All for you @412979 🤣😘
@SpotifyCares Any possibility of making a Japanese group under genres? That would be really awesome ;)
@SpotifyCares its all good it disappeared, thanks tho https://t.co/gBGafZe42R
@SpotifyCares just being a jerk about how old this track makes me feel. :)
@SpotifyCares No. And now none if the playlist r playing even though they're downloaded for offline use
@SpotifyCares i signed up 2 years ago and still its not in pakistan
@SpotifyCares Okay. Thank you for your help.
@SpotifyCares I’m on an iPhone 7 and I have the Spotify version 8.4.22 , I’ve tried updating it but it hasn’t worked at all. https://t.co/j0Jj37yWHP
@SpotifyCares Thank you for that.. But we will wait Day6 ✨ @18284
@SpotifyCares Replied with a pm 😊
@SpotifyCares Submitted. Most definitely expecting this to be in the next update.
@SpotifyCares My laptop! There used to be a lyrics option that never came back
@SpotifyCares Thank u! I hope the lyrics option on desktop comes back tho 😊
@SpotifyCares Can you help me
@SpotifyCares Oh it's back again. Thanks anyway. 😊
@SpotifyCares I am using a Huawei P9 Lite. Spotify version 8.4.23.784 armV7.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s
Spotify 8.4.25.906
iOS 11.1
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the info but I can’t see how this improves my Spotify experience in the slightest. One less way of using it, basically.
@SpotifyCares Okay, please do, and thanks for your help anyway 👍
@SpotifyCares Get this on, u won't regret it x 
https://t.co/I4kgpvJtj3
@SpotifyCares ho la con de tes morts help me I need help
@SpotifyCares Yes but the all songs of the app are Grey now what does that mean ?
@SpotifyCares La vie de ma mère that dont work
@SpotifyCares Hi there, already got some help via email, thanks anyway 😉
@SpotifyCares Oooh yeah https://t.co/8DVSJXmm0h
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/QiLzD9LjhB
@SpotifyCares There wont be an iPhone x update soon?
@SpotifyCares Great! Yes, so I suppose they also count for the end of the year playlist "Your Top Songs 20##"?
@SpotifyCares The normal bar at the bottom under now playing had disappeared but I logged out and in and it’s back :) thanks though
@SpotifyCares Thanks lads it's appreciated
@SpotifyCares Well then yall need to come to an agreement with them because @18284 are so good and so under appreciated
@SpotifyCares Got it to open by resetting the region (https://t.co/vliebyNS8r)
@SpotifyCares Well her music was available on Spotify but was almost immediately took off.. can you tell me why please??
@SpotifyCares Already did, thanks. Hopefully by 2020 we will have access to it. 😉👍🏻
@SpotifyCares There's no song here just an album cover https://t.co/NxsZLb0Rr3
@SpotifyCares @487182 https://t.co/g3LYwKMTqj
@SpotifyCares How come there is no "open in app automatically" feature?
@SpotifyCares So it’s indeed not possible without a different device? Big bummer.. Really hope it’ll be fixed soon
@SpotifyCares But how? To do that I'd still need a spotify app on my LG TV right? TV doesn't pop up when I open devices available
@SpotifyCares Got the X update today—thanks!
@SpotifyCares i sent it you as DM
@SpotifyCares "Sorry. This radio station can't be started. Please try another station." warning in Weekly Playlist Radio https://t.co/JDdpD3PM9Y
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/5XRKAu325F
@SpotifyCares Lol... How do you know it's not available in my country without checking my account?
@SpotifyCares Sounds great, and thank you! &lt;3
@SpotifyCares I'm just a single, premium subscriber hoping to make my life and playlists easier to maneuver.
@SpotifyCares No offense but that was not a good update. I used it frequently &amp; don't save as many songs now
@SpotifyCares 9 seconds to 2:37. Any device. But it's not present on other streaming services
@SpotifyCares Neither of these worked. I tried multiple times, on different browser and on a phone/laptop/my pc.
@SpotifyCares No, I am not using a VPN.
@SpotifyCares Wow that post is nearly 2 yrs old &amp; you havent done anything. Why dont you have any info? Are you saying no one at spotify has even discussed idea of creating native chrome os app? Surely someone has &amp; you could find out if you really wanted to? Or I guess Spotify doesnt care!
@SpotifyCares Thanks, hope it will be implemented soon.
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Windows computer. Thanks for taking notice of this.
@SpotifyCares Why does it automatically appear for paying customers, though?  And thanks!
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/Y9o40BsgbH
@SpotifyCares @488330 I completely agree that this is absolutely ridiculous.
@SpotifyCares virgin
@SpotifyCares Please we need this!! Is it even it the works??
@SpotifyCares Thanks!!!
@SpotifyCares i open the web player and try to play a sound but a pink error occurs while the songs rapidly change until an add plays
@SpotifyCares well the pink error no longer shows up for some reason but the songs do still skip rapidly and then play 3-4 ads in between
@SpotifyCares logging in and out does not work but thank you for helping
@SpotifyCares i did clear the cache and the problem is still there.
@SpotifyCares i believe i am on a home network but the problem still continues when i am on a public one
@SpotifyCares i was not but the problem would most likely stay the same. i’ve seen the problem happen while i’m on other networks and ive seen it happen to a friends computer not too long ago
@SpotifyCares yes, the same thing still happens
@SpotifyCares My new iPhone X won’t bring up the Spotify app in my 2017 Mini Cooper...
@SpotifyCares Running on iPhone X (the app is not updated to support the device yet) https://t.co/bmZPOdWtSF
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.1 and it doesn’t help!
@SpotifyCares Not fixed, probably a bug, staying with Spotify because the costumer service is amazing; compensates the baggy bugs
@SpotifyCares I have to dowload all my songs an another time this week because they’re decide to be deleted for no reasons 😖
@SpotifyCares this is why i was like « wtf is happening??» 😂 https://t.co/Dh8SEqBDWL
@SpotifyCares thank you honey have a nice day 😌
@SpotifyCares Thank you, I didn't know this. Just submitted my idea!
@SpotifyCares Thanks, that looks to have fixed it. Hopefully it won’t reoccur. Any ETA on an iPhone X update?
@SpotifyCares Hopefully it will be soon, right now the app looks terrible. Thanks again for your help.
@SpotifyCares It is happening again...this is so annoying. https://t.co/g0GHVnXo8L
@SpotifyCares So I’m just not able to listen to anything other than the current playlists on my home screen? Why am I paying for this if it doesn’t work?
@SpotifyCares Nice, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Nah man it's your app without premium I can't play whatever song I want on mobile, therefore, Spotify is dumb
@SpotifyCares You bets be sorry imma go listen to @129941
@SpotifyCares lol I'll still use Spotify, just not on mobile bc that shits dumb
@SpotifyCares You too bud but it's night rn
@SpotifyCares Okay Thank you for your fast response :) have a Good one
@SpotifyCares Im dm u! Just to make sure i dont share anything sensitive to my devices
@SpotifyCares Always have automatic downloads on 😬
@SpotifyCares Done! Thanks DB!
@SpotifyCares Thanks DB but when I click song options all I get are these. When I click 'Add To Playlist' I only get option to create new one. https://t.co/n5tVdluL60
@SpotifyCares I did but I need good music though Apple music doesn't have the music I like. All youtubers put their music on spotify only
@SpotifyCares amazing! thanks so much :)
@SpotifyCares I'm on an iPhone 6s and using Spotify free, would being on Spotify free affect it?
@SpotifyCares Should’ve indicated that during the paymet process to avoid confusion.
@SpotifyCares Great stuff, Samsung UA55JU6400. Thanks
@SpotifyCares It just sits on the Spotify load screen. We have no issue with wifi on any other programs. https://t.co/MGRBXBi8mw
@SpotifyCares Private browsing didn't work, but @144408 did the trick. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares 8.4.25.771. And yes, the same message.
@SpotifyCares My Spotify plays on other (bt) devices. It's a car related thing.
@SpotifyCares 2014 BMW 320d xDrive
@SpotifyCares Ok. But it's odd that it worked perfectly before the Oreo update...
@SpotifyCares Ok, thanks!
@SpotifyCares How it's an improve when people can't listen anymore from their TV?
@SpotifyCares Yes nice but i can't use spotify connect without the TV app. Is there any chance in the future to bring the app back for older Smart TV's?
@SpotifyCares Ok thank you!
@SpotifyCares I got to chat with J.V. and he helped me in getting back my Spotify account! I'm thankful for his help and the professionalism he showed! :D
@SpotifyCares I'm on a Galaxy J7. I'll open the app and it just gets stuck loading for minutes.
@SpotifyCares This has been happened for I would say the greater part of 2017. Can hear ambient sounds through the loudest setting on my beats headphones
@SpotifyCares Couldn’t say I mostly listen mobile
@SpotifyCares Happens on everything. Soundcloud is noticeably louder. Nope
@SpotifyCares Would really rather you just put in a bug report w/ devs. I love Spotify but this volume issue honestly kills it
@SpotifyCares Any idea of when? They're a deal breaker for me. If it's not soon, I'll cancel my membership and return when you offer them.
@SpotifyCares Much appreciated. I got Spotify to discover new music, &amp; without Radio it just not very easy to do that.
@SpotifyCares Is this limitation based on my current location, or my account being Thai? If I were to suddenly find myself in the US, could I use radio?
@SpotifyCares Ok. I was hopeful that a VPN could help, but I guess not. Thanks for the help.
@SpotifyCares Thank you I'll sign it later
@SpotifyCares why you keep changing features and ruining the experience :(
@SpotifyCares I love Spotify but some changes don't make sense to us.. Thanks for passing the feedback!
@SpotifyCares Spotify has finally been updated to accommodate iPhone X! FYI, I had to delete and reinstall the app (the automatic update did not correct the screen issue). @SpotifyCares https://t.co/pQmxwtcfxm
@SpotifyCares spotify:track:2RfwK0DOl7ijlKBEhZsyuN
spotify:track:0P7wa8dTJYpy05CggXqkLB
Many more. spotify:artist:2nQKUeZeleLGNsJj6WLUXN doesn't remix
@SpotifyCares United States!
@SpotifyCares Okay! Thanks for getting back to me :)
@SpotifyCares oh, it's already fixed now. 😅
it was started at 1:46 several times before. I use Spotify on PC.
@SpotifyCares Ahhh, I see. So I guess what I really meant to tweet was...PUT THE LG APP BACK!! 🙄 #whydoyouhateme
@SpotifyCares So far so good
@SpotifyCares Apparently it's been the best part of a decade since this basic feature has been requested. They're already tagged, just let me filter them.
@SpotifyCares But please consider making it an option to change country for recommendations etc. The way it works now is bonkers. Globalization y'all.
@SpotifyCares Device: Xiaomi Redmi note 4, Lollypop
Spotify version: 8.4.23.784 armV7
@SpotifyCares 5.1.1 LMY47V. Sorry, i mean my device is Redmi note 3, and this problem also occur when i listening the downloaded songs on my playlist
@SpotifyCares Go look at it. Tons of phone numbers posted for help desks like amazon, etc
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/8te4DqryDx              Guess nobody pays much attention to those.
@SpotifyCares Thank you 😤💕
@SpotifyCares i have subscribed to premium account but why still registered as a free account user? i try to log out then log in but nothing changes
@SpotifyCares yeah, I'm having some issues playing my playlists
@SpotifyCares virgin
@SpotifyCares Oh sorry. Going to follow up with dm
@SpotifyCares it was saying "Okay, I'll play [artist/song/etc]" not doing anything...but when I looked at the app, time was running but it wasn't playing
@SpotifyCares Awesome. I had no doubt that it would be updated. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I know that. However this UX will lead to that I won’t convert in the near future. No digital tech
@SpotifyCares Ok thank you for that
@SpotifyCares Just an example but problem is specific to #Chromecast and exists for all albums https://t.co/lxX2gIf5Qv
@SpotifyCares or https://t.co/qmmDkDs518 it‘s indeed an issue. pls fix it
@SpotifyCares It's an iPhone 6, operating system of 10.3.3, and I've included a pic of the version of Spotify. Seems to only be Kelsea's playlist. https://t.co/1yszi7odty
@SpotifyCares I've tried a few other artists and it appears to only be Kelsea Ballerini's playlist.
@SpotifyCares Very odd! I tried it on my Chromebook and it seems to play fine there.
@SpotifyCares That seems to have fixed the issue. Thanks!!
@SpotifyCares Its with version 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares @313043 To be more clear here: The popularity contest you linked intends to bring to your attention things you may not have thought of. This request is clearly at your attention right this very moment, and by telling people "vote for it or its not gonna happen", you show you don't care.
@SpotifyCares @313043 That's a bullshit response and merely an excuse to not have to make the decision.
@SpotifyCares "sorry you feel that way" Do you aim to insult people?

If you think i'm full of shit, say it directly.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/hiY5pERSqr
@SpotifyCares Samsung, Android, Version 8.4.23.784 armV7
Sorry for the late reply. I can see some of the songs again, but there's still one missing.
@SpotifyCares I'm sure the mrkt team uses zip codes to generalize what they think individuals want to hear but not always the case
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares It's been suggested 2 years ago 😔
@SpotifyCares Is it true that I have to remove downloaded songs one by one, or remove all of them at once by deleting and reinstalling the app?
@SpotifyCares You didn’t answer my question.
@SpotifyCares Tried this and get the following error https://t.co/n4WRGmLFwB
@SpotifyCares the distributor in this case has nothing to do with this group appearing on her page
@SpotifyCares It pauses every 20 secs.wont cast to chromecast or ps4 either. https://t.co/DaxQ8uXfbm
@SpotifyCares On all connections, as out in car it's pausing.but songs are saved in library.it plays for 10-15 secs when casting and pauses still.
@SpotifyCares Now it's casting to chromecast but can't control music. When I go to next song it plays out loud on phone, and current song stays on tv
@SpotifyCares Might be worth noting, this has only happened since the new Android OS was released yesterday, as it's messed up loads of other things too.
@SpotifyCares Still the same 😔 this is so annoying. Pausing constantly.
@SpotifyCares Phone. Chromecast. Ps4. It's really starting to annoy me.
@SpotifyCares Also why does my girlfriends account go three or more songs between ads and mine usually one after being a long time premium account
@SpotifyCares Spotify followed up by thanking me for watching the ad and then informing me that I could enjoy the next 30 minutes of ad free listening
@SpotifyCares Yeah I'm trying to get the discount. When I press the "get premium" button and login then it tells me I'm not eligible for the discount. But I'm a student in Ontario.
@SpotifyCares Please do SA soon. My best friend has been waiting years to hear my playlists.
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares Weird, I opened iTunes and then it restored my media controls. Must be a High Sierra bug I guess 👍
@SpotifyCares Crashed when I opened the app to start playing music over Bluetooth in the car. And my entire library of music was deleted
@SpotifyCares No error message. The app would freeze and when shut off and reopened I’d be logged out. Upon logging in every downloaded song is gone
@SpotifyCares It first happened after updating to ios11 then again yesterday. Both times have been in the car and both times I’ve lost 3k songs
@SpotifyCares Hi, spotify version 8.4.22.515, iPhone 6S iOS 11.0.3. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Hi, with a WiFi connection the app worked. Now it works also if I disable all my connections (WiFi, 4G)
@SpotifyCares E.G. in a playlist with Praying (Sam) and You Don't Do it For me (Demi), songs such as Ruin the Friendship (Demi) and He Like that (Fifth Harmony) don't really fit.
@SpotifyCares The download limit (you’re the only streaming service with one) and removing downloads I’ve made.
@SpotifyCares I already told you I have done that.
@SpotifyCares I don't know how long as I've not had to enter a new card in years. I have now entered a card so it's no longer possible to check....
@SpotifyCares It was in your app, not a browser.
@SpotifyCares Sorry just seeing this, ok gonna try soon. Will update u
@SpotifyCares Cool! When do you expect it to come out?
@SpotifyCares App
@SpotifyCares @497162 all my playlists disappeared ... but no help in the last 2 days..
@SpotifyCares Any news for me ... plz !
@SpotifyCares I also just replied ...
@SpotifyCares Alright thanks
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply!
@SpotifyCares LOL thank you!!!!!!!!
@SpotifyCares @115888 Is there a reason for this? Because it is the only negative thing with using you're service which I'm very pleased with
@SpotifyCares Thank you 💚
@SpotifyCares Nevermind found the 'Absolute Treasures: The Rocky Horror Picture Show' album.
@SpotifyCares No :( This one https://t.co/oKay0xrsKH cc @66150 @148611
@SpotifyCares Thank you RS!! ❤️
@SpotifyCares I’ll try again and let you know
@SpotifyCares Oh, sorry I meant to follow up! It started working once I quit Spotify that was running on another Mac – hope that helps problemshoot.
@SpotifyCares Very similar thing on MacOS, here’s a video. iOS 11.1, iPhone 7. https://t.co/Di3c8kWnoB
@SpotifyCares please please please @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares android but I have the same problem when I use spotify on my laptop as well. + spotify premium
@SpotifyCares USA? It was listed before and all of a sudden it disappeared. All El Alfa’s songs are listed except that one 😡
@SpotifyCares For one specific song?
@SpotifyCares What should I do? https://t.co/osPdpUoORp
@SpotifyCares I sent an email to __email__ but no-one replies and recently submitted a form vía web but you'll send the answer to the hacker. :-/
@SpotifyCares I’ve already did that, and the form I’ve submitted results as *you* sending an email with instructions not to me, but to the hacker email account.
@SpotifyCares We're crossing emails, thanks. :-)
@SpotifyCares I've posted on there since 2014. Nothing has changed...
@SpotifyCares I believe folks have been asking for this for a long while. Odd that it appears when I output the audio to my PS4.
@SpotifyCares Did regression testing not catch that it redirects the login to the accounts page to the redirect to main page. Loop is stuck somewhere.
@SpotifyCares 1.0.66.478.g1296534d running on a 13in macbook pro w OSx 10.12.6
@SpotifyCares Pixel
@SpotifyCares Reinstall chrome?  Uh no. This is the web player.
@SpotifyCares That works. I narrowed it down to a chrome extension "Disable HTML5 autoplay" -  i turned it off and it seems to be working now
@SpotifyCares :-)
@SpotifyCares Okey! Thanks for the help anyways, great support☺️🤙🏽
@SpotifyCares Thank You ❤
@SpotifyCares several songs have incorrect/mismatched titles. two songs even have the same titles.

@SpotifyCares Cheers Done.
@SpotifyCares Huawei p9 lite/android
@SpotifyCares currently using version 8.4.25.771. I only use it on a computer besides from the phone and i dont have the feature there either
@SpotifyCares Care teams don’t get the love they deserve. Thanks for your response and action.
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares I know this is a feature on iOS and i find it very useful and want it on android
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares Glad to see the integration of others’ messaging platforms. Much better than before! Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Or at least you can tell me that my account is being blocked because i didn’t verification my spotify family
@SpotifyCares Tried it. Didn't work :( still getting the same issue
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.1 and Spotify Version 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares UK. Some songs from are unavailable except some which, although unavailable on the album list, are still playable from my own playlist..?
@SpotifyCares Sorted now, thanks for your reply though!
@SpotifyCares The person logged out. Is there something where I can see wich devices have ever logged in in my Spotify account? (2/2)
help plz @SpotifyCares it says "song is not available", also won't let me listen to any lily allen but all other artists I've tried are fine
@SpotifyCares it's only on my laptop that it doesn't work (asus zenbook UX305), and the spotify version is 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02. on my phone it's fine!
@SpotifyCares I've been using my earphones the whole time &amp; it's still only certain artists that don't play. can't rly check speakers atm (in a library)
@SpotifyCares I don't have any local files of these artists !
@SpotifyCares please can you resolve this issue by deleting all his music?
@SpotifyCares No, it's fine thank you for caring xoxo
@SpotifyCares hello spotify if you could please help me with this that would be great, i really need to listen to jessica simpson
@SpotifyCares Hello! The newest version of IOS and version 8.4.25 on Spotify ! Thank you!:)
@SpotifyCares Nope - not working, also uninstalled it and reinstalled it......I’m assuming it’s an @115858 problem..
@SpotifyCares Nope, no luck unfortunately!
@SpotifyCares no error messages. Devices just not listed as if I don't have a Premium acct.
@SpotifyCares OK. Thanks. If I wanted to import my existing iTunes to Spotify, how do I do it? Done in the past ages ago but want to copy latest. File-&gt; Import Playlists-&gt; iTunes does nothing
@SpotifyCares I would but I cannot find my email address linked to the account. The only information I have is my username is "andrewwolter"
@SpotifyCares I also cannot log it because my password is lost. Thus, my problem. I'm still logged in on the app if that helps.
@SpotifyCares If you gave me the email address connected to the account I could try to access it
@SpotifyCares This does not look familiar. Is there anything else you can tell me?
@SpotifyCares i️ signed up for hulu + spotify student discount. spotify took out $4.99 as agreed but hulu took their full portion out. did i️ miss a step?
@SpotifyCares The help guide says I need to update my payment method to the new country but it won't allow that because it says it doesn't match
@SpotifyCares Yes!
@SpotifyCares Like, it'll say it's playing the song, but no time will elapse, or if it does there will be no sound. Meaning either restart or fiddle.
@SpotifyCares Thank you guys for implement this new feature 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
@SpotifyCares True but from the point of view of user interface, should automatically or at least add the button for refresh
@SpotifyCares No, doesn't help. Opening any of these albums gives the same series of 3 under 'More from', exactly same order. 1 of them is not 'more'. https://t.co/S1K8WoBivi
@SpotifyCares this is not cool!
@SpotifyCares Thanks but Emmanuel Y already helped me .
@SpotifyCares @503706 Check out our video, we spoke very highly of Spotify, she should be a sponsor! 😂😂 Thanks for helping my friend

https://t.co/CAshAxrupn
@SpotifyCares It's really unfair that she's using others song to promote her own, being on 37737x playlist isn't enough for her? pls do something @115888
@SpotifyCares its still happening. thanks for doing something. I think it happens to other countries only, I'm from Philippines.
https://t.co/7BmozNpzXS
@SpotifyCares just took this screen shot. Sue them for using others for promotion. https://t.co/APILFXdIgL
@SpotifyCares Will there ever be a shortcut for it
@SpotifyCares People want it
@SpotifyCares I’ve already DMed you an still haven’t gotten a response.
@SpotifyCares Why would I️ do this when you’ve already bashed the idea? https://t.co/HVaThml7LD
@SpotifyCares If so: how do I cancel premium for this account so that I can make a new one?
@SpotifyCares @115888 See also this video @SpotifyCares https://t.co/7HaiomSuOL
@SpotifyCares App does not match device resolution. Sometimes the bottom nav bar of Spotify gets hidden and cant use its functions
@SpotifyCares looking forward to the big improvements!
@SpotifyCares I'm using a 2017 Samsung A5, running Android 7.0, with Spotify 8.4.23.784 armV7
@SpotifyCares I've tried that, I've also uninstalled and reinstalled which didn't help, but when I try my music without wifi on there's no distortion
@SpotifyCares I haven't tried that yet, but other people have said that they aren't having any issues
@SpotifyCares On the iOS app it simply doesn’t play. On my desktop app, it says the album is not available, but I can import it.
@SpotifyCares It, unfortunately, did not work. I've attached a picture of what's happening: https://t.co/tF43rm1JrH
@SpotifyCares No bueno. Still can’t listen to the album on either device.
@SpotifyCares even tried with the web player, and no dice
@SpotifyCares Thank you for clearly avoiding my question
@SpotifyCares Thanks guys 👌🏻
@SpotifyCares @116130 I’m actually really concerned about how this could happen, is there a way to see if any of these pre-save apps are doing this?
@SpotifyCares Looks likely that the 137k followers have been added this way... If it's equal across all the playlists 👀. Will u let us know?
@SpotifyCares Bummer. By the way sound controls aren’t working on mobile when in lock mode
@SpotifyCares Latest on Mac
@SpotifyCares This is a feature request, not a bug. Do you have this feature in your mac software for ANY make or model?
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Having to type this info means that I never share on mobile—a shame 😕
@SpotifyCares Thank you, @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares @115888 any sugesstion on how to deal with this?
@SpotifyCares Thanks! It’s waze (autocorrect to wave) happens when I start my car and open up the Spotify app. Will follow up with a screen cap ASAP.
@SpotifyCares It never goes away. @SpotifyCares https://t.co/gbZxy6a9eT
@SpotifyCares Boom. Fixed. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thank youu!!!! ❤️❤️
@SpotifyCares The noise that appears when you switch/pause/play a song on spotify on iphones
@SpotifyCares I have not. I'll try that now. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares No luck
@SpotifyCares @498547 Happens to me with some Red Hot Chili Peppers songs :/
@SpotifyCares I've been getting this message for quite a few artists now. The music appears to be available but won't play. Friends say it works for them. https://t.co/7HLp6M9iui
@SpotifyCares Hey! 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 on PC/Windows 7. It says "this song is not available" for every track by Frank Ocean and King Krule.
@SpotifyCares Yeah, the same thing happens on my Huawei P9 Lite, these tracks only play in the web player for me now.
@SpotifyCares Yes, I've also tried reinstalling.
@SpotifyCares I have not noticed anything else not working. Restart and log in/out did not work either.
@SpotifyCares Yes, it does.
@SpotifyCares Iphone X optimization!!  Why are u taking so long!!!
@SpotifyCares Great customer service! Hopefully when I see some new changes, I will. https://t.co/RBEIEn2eWi
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your response. I do not, simply find your app UI / design dismel looking and not very user "friendly" noar inviting. Thanks! ✌️
@SpotifyCares I got it to work like right after I sent this tweet but thank you
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Just think that current singles should be put on playlists that intend to give a snapshot of an artist.
@SpotifyCares Hai.my spotify account playlist and subscription suddenly gone.when i was logged in again, spotify website ask new subscription with $99/mth
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response! I did try that list of solutions before I gave up. I'm on a S7 Edge, Android Version 7.0 if that helps
@SpotifyCares :’)))))) &lt;33
@SpotifyCares to be more specific my problem was I don't want Indonesian/Korean songs be included in the playlist. I just don't listen to them.
@SpotifyCares I put in my Australian credit card details and it says Spotify hasn't launched there yet.
@SpotifyCares I want to change country and payment details but it's not working as the help articles states it should. Can't change country.
@SpotifyCares well it’s such a huge miss 
Come on @81154 , let’s work something out and let’s all be friends while listening to heaven https://t.co/ICKIC6VMJW
@SpotifyCares cool! Well... perhaps y’all could hit @81165 up because their podcast is awesome and we’ll love to have it on Spotify too
@SpotifyCares Yup.
@SpotifyCares Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Actually - another question. Weirdly, it says it doesn't work because I haven't listened to enough. This is odd. I've listened probaby -
@SpotifyCares almost everyday since 2015.
@SpotifyCares Nope. The only one is see is Throwback Thursday and a couple other like 00's, 90's, 80's, etc.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/RGH1HRJIlB
@SpotifyCares Thanks :D
@SpotifyCares By the way @9242, this may involve you too.
@SpotifyCares I could, but it has nothing to do with that. I have Windows comps that work fine. Right now, it's the default settings on Mac (~nothing)
@SpotifyCares Yep, login worked. Just to be clear, this has been going on for a while (a couple years maybe), but I thought it was just junk build-up.
@SpotifyCares After a clean install, I realized that wasn't the case.
@SpotifyCares It's a fresh install of the OS and thus Spotify, so I already did technically
@SpotifyCares I quit Chrome the other day and this immediately happened to Spotify. Closest I've come to finding others w/ same: https://t.co/sgorX6j37s https://t.co/qLHHMcQhBc
@SpotifyCares This only happens on one computer: MacBook Pro 2011 17" - any OS (it's happened on all of them since at least Yosemite). Any thoughts? (2/2)
@SpotifyCares thanks!
@SpotifyCares An uninstalled/reinstalled app fixed it, and everything is back to normal. Please don't let that become the new normal!
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Which folder? It is no longer in the local files folder on Spotify, but I’ll check the folder on my computer.
@SpotifyCares It didn’t work. It’s been removed from my local files for quite some time. The song is already on Spotify, I no longer need the local file.
@SpotifyCares MacBook/OS Sierra and iPhone. Most current up to date models. Spotify in pic. https://t.co/pJcCqkXpJe
@SpotifyCares I also tried reinstalling.
@SpotifyCares Thank you! I'll keep my eye out for any news with it and appreciate you reaching out.
@SpotifyCares Hey there! It's the latest version of Windows 10, and the updated version of the app from the Windows store. Restarting doesn't help sadly!
@SpotifyCares Sure. On both PS4 and Amazon Echo, each playlist only plays a few songs, then stops altogether. I can't skip ahead or anything.
@SpotifyCares iphone 7 latest version
@SpotifyCares It says error connecting to PlayStation network and everything is fine besides Spotify. I have an Ethernet cable connected
@SpotifyCares it’s okay, i’ll figure something out
@SpotifyCares Done... and I will just continue waiting...
@SpotifyCares Did got no response
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/di24JirARn
@SpotifyCares where is HELLO. we want the FULL album
@SpotifyCares Thanks gang
@SpotifyCares Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Options for more equalisers.
@SpotifyCares Please! Thank youuu
@SpotifyCares Or we should use US vpn
@SpotifyCares I wonder if some musics we stream using indonesia vpn would be count on hot billboard or not?
@SpotifyCares We both know it is already being developed, so my vote is worthless. I would just like to understand the timescale for its release, because
@SpotifyCares If it is long term, I will switch to an alternative provider who can offer this.
@SpotifyCares Thanks, as you are unable to offer the service I require, I shall cancel my account &amp; sign up with a provider who can offer this feature.
@SpotifyCares I dont know how to put a music on offline .
@SpotifyCares Thankyou .
@SpotifyCares Sure did ☺️
@SpotifyCares Nope it happens quite often!
@SpotifyCares It's just that the picture is one ahead like if you see on the left side. It's the real picture... It have happened two times today
@SpotifyCares I think the latest Spotify version... but suddenly it's fixed now
@SpotifyCares NOOO I DON’T want that!
It seemed like it tho.
@SpotifyCares you responded over an hour late ,,, you broke my heart .... i'm switching to apple music now
@SpotifyCares Here 
https://t.co/BFs8LsYTjK
@SpotifyCares will the song be added eventually ?!
@SpotifyCares Yes app is closed.Just started today.
Galaxy 7 Android
@SpotifyCares Version 8.4.24.871 spotify
@SpotifyCares Ok will try
@SpotifyCares Looks ok so far.....
@SpotifyCares Hey, It is spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 and Windows 10 as OS.
@SpotifyCares Both do not solve issue. This was introduced just recently though, i think maybe 2 weeks ago? No problems on other devices with same version
@SpotifyCares a double reinstall seemed to fix it (at least for now). Still don't know what caused it, but thanks!
@SpotifyCares Look at the borders fam https://t.co/M3ot8E4xYH
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/oMyQFsUzdN

only one song comes up. my accounts linked to the philippines.
@SpotifyCares follow me all please 😀&amp; who can share my music in his playlist?

https://t.co/DQrUR21Y2N
@SpotifyCares Ugh, and all of my downloads and music is totally overwritten. Come on.
@SpotifyCares I noticed b/c as I’m having coffee and listening to jazz, someone fired up web player and stopped my stream to play crap I’ve never heard of
@SpotifyCares I changed password, seems to be okay now. What’s this about? Should I expect more trouble?
@SpotifyCares Ors résolve thx
@SpotifyCares When will we get an update for iPhone X screen ? It's all cropped
@SpotifyCares I'm on iOS 11.1 &amp; Spotify 8.4.25.906 but i don't know if this really matters
@SpotifyCares Thanks.Otherwise, nothing sets you apart from other music streaming services. @117168 could allow users to be more interactive w/ others
@SpotifyCares We've been voting for 29 years nothing gets done
@SpotifyCares @477814 Is it ever going to happen? How can you not offer a product across the full OS Spectrum. Bogus especially since Apple Watch has cellular now
@SpotifyCares I️ want to hear from Spotify not a social media management company!
@SpotifyCares iOS 11, iPhone se, spotify version 8.4.25, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Closing the app out and reopening worked, thanks! Search is HUGE
@SpotifyCares Your ads play WAY too much. I got 3 ads promising ad-free music in the span of 45 minutes
@SpotifyCares Nope. Not at all
@SpotifyCares Yes, it automatically plays, and it played the whole thing
@SpotifyCares Sometimes the music i am listening to just stops for no reason and today when i go to play an album it will not select it or i listen to an
@SpotifyCares No i dont the issue where it wont play songs has started today and the issue where songs just stop has happened for weeks
@SpotifyCares I have restarted my phone but it still happens i have also uninstalled the app to try to fix it in the past but no luck
@SpotifyCares Sure
@SpotifyCares Sent
@SpotifyCares thanks. The forums have lots of people having the same issue for specific artists but no correlation.
@SpotifyCares Basically I just wish you would update the iOS app for the iPhone X 🤗
@SpotifyCares Thanks 😘
@SpotifyCares 1 album
@SpotifyCares Ipod touch 6th gen. 8.4.3.884
@SpotifyCares I think theres no problem if i will resync it again. 🙂__email__ 🙂
@SpotifyCares No I would rather just use a username, if I make a new account is it easy to swap my subscription over ?
@SpotifyCares nuyuhmusic - email; __email__
@SpotifyCares Everything is working fine now! Thanks for the support, best support experience I've ever had on a paid service! Kudos!
@SpotifyCares It's ok Spotify you're my favorite app in my phone and I don't mind the French music I like the diversity ❤️
@SpotifyCares It's the web player.
@SpotifyCares Cleared cache and cookies, had to sign in again and still does it... only seems to happen in the web player, mobile and desktop are ok.
@SpotifyCares Version 8.2.0.549 and os 11 ( although was like this when I had ios 9)
@SpotifyCares Thanks good stuff that ya care
@SpotifyCares Hey KL, it doesn't actually work on the Desktop app. Is a Mac vs PC thing? I have the PC version installed on my work CPU, fwiw.
@SpotifyCares I have v1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares Will try that in a bit. Can't reboot at the moment. :) tyvm
@SpotifyCares Thank you! We love you @115888
@SpotifyCares App works exactly as intended, I fear. ☹️

It has none of the daily mixes I have in my other devices.
@SpotifyCares Roku doesn’t show up, though I’m standing in front of it, on the same home network.
@SpotifyCares Searching for artist is moderately more useful, unless you’re looking for a song by an artist like Tom Waits, who has a huge catalog.
@SpotifyCares Is that enough for now? I can add more items, those are off the top of my head. I can fire up the app later, it is very quick to load.
@SpotifyCares Which is good, because it doesn’t do a lot. 😕
@SpotifyCares No ballad of Lupe Montosa. https://t.co/na6MTNJ6sI
@SpotifyCares It seems to be working now though
@SpotifyCares The problem appears to have fixed itself now. The problem was on a PC with Windows 10 for reference.
@SpotifyCares The situation seems to have sorted itself out. I was trying to access https://t.co/SjP20017SK
@SpotifyCares device: windows 7 pc, spotify web latest version on chrome.. i cant' login with my mail or facebook account.. everytime logout of theaccount
@SpotifyCares Thanks man! Will wait patiently.
@SpotifyCares It's working now. Don't know what changed..thanks.
@SpotifyCares But it’s been this way for months! And I️ never listen to the Chris Brown tracks intentionally but they keep popping up
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I️ don’t listen to him and I️ don’t think my friends do either so hopefully he won’t show up anymore
@SpotifyCares iOS update seems to have fixed the issue. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares thanks!!
@SpotifyCares It's been ten years and many of companies started their products in india.. even india had more 100 edm concert but still waiting
@SpotifyCares everything's working now....
@SpotifyCares thnaks 👍🏼
@SpotifyCares I'm back up. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the help though, @SpotifyCares!
@SpotifyCares Just checked both devices and it seems to be fixed now. Playlists/albums/etc showed up fine, only my list of saved songs was problematic.
@SpotifyCares Actually I think it might've been a comcast issue - everything is okay now. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Hi I meant, on desktop. Is there an equalizer for desktop spotify?
@SpotifyCares okay, i found this: https://t.co/0SFg8VJpBC

looks like there's not going to be one...equalizers are a standard of music players though.
@SpotifyCares Okay, thanks
@SpotifyCares yes it was. I've since uninstalled the program, but haven't had a minute to re-install. Let you know ASAP
@SpotifyCares @513381 Same issue. iOS. Logged out of app --&gt; restarted device --&gt; logged in --&gt; same behavior, same issue
@SpotifyCares the problem appears to have been resolved, but thanks! I️t all worky now haha
@SpotifyCares Omg thanks! As long as it’s not gone forever 🙏
@SpotifyCares Thank you. But does that move an account., or just delete it along with the history and playlists etc?
@SpotifyCares But I want the playlists etc associated with the account to me moved to stay with it once it gets recreated. Is that possible?
@SpotifyCares Google chrome.  Did it twice this morning but has been fine for last hour or two
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/V2SxAWQkKJ
@SpotifyCares I just plugged into my Ethernet cord and it’s giving the same screen
@SpotifyCares Sweet thanks
@SpotifyCares Well Spotify Chromebook kept logging me out and wouldnt load the launcher
@SpotifyCares Yea its says likesorry spotify isnt working try again later or it will just tell me to log in and i log in and it take me back to the log in
@SpotifyCares first I keep getting a 400 Bad request, when i can get through the browser is in spanish, and on top of that nothing plays
@SpotifyCares On my laptop using Windows 10. I've got the latest Spotify I'm assuming. Everything else is fine, it's literally just that album is jumpy.
@SpotifyCares Hey there! Thanks for following up- he created a new account and used that to reach out, and got everything fixed. Have a great day!
@SpotifyCares Now his/our account is disabled, browser error for both of us when we try to access, can't re-engage support. Help?
@SpotifyCares Im shook
@SpotifyCares Wait you actually answered
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!!
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/hHVm178CcO
@SpotifyCares Working now
@SpotifyCares awesome, you guys rock!
@SpotifyCares Im going to go premium , im using globe prepaid to pay , it alwyas says"somethings wrong" ,
@SpotifyCares Android
@SpotifyCares the web player. randomly stops playing, logs me out, then either won’t let me log back in or play anything.
@SpotifyCares I’m home now and it seems to working correctly. I’m not sure what happened.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares It’s every week lol I enjoy my daily mix! But typically those are songs I’ve heard. I like looking for new music but the DW isn’t doing it 💔
@SpotifyCares Thank you 😊
@SpotifyCares &lt;3
@SpotifyCares Okay!
@SpotifyCares I still need you for my problem,because it has not been solved yet
@SpotifyCares Before reinstalling Spotify, it was the "Release Radar" playlist. /2
@SpotifyCares Pls respond
@SpotifyCares I dont want to try it as it will take another week to download songs maybe?
@SpotifyCares Cheers I am chatting to one of your advisors on the old chat room! thanks
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares No
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.1 and Spotify version 8.4.25
@SpotifyCares It recovered about 10 minutes after I tweeted you (I didn't change anything).
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Keep me posted!
@SpotifyCares BlackBerry KeyONE running Nougat.   Spotify version 8.4.28.875 arm v7
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/xp2oUFY5sf
@SpotifyCares I did that and also uninstalled Spotify and reinstalled and ensured the storage setting was set to the SD card before downloading my playlists. Same issue.
@SpotifyCares I didn't bother uninstalling and reinstalling. I did eject the SD card and there were no downloaded songs available in the app. So they are stored on the card but show as using internal storage space. Hmmm.
@SpotifyCares Phone: Samsung Galaxy 6, OS: Android 7.0, Spotify Version: 8.4.28.875.
@SpotifyCares "We're launching regularly in countries around the world." - And yet seems like Serbia or any other Balkan country isn't on the huge ball we call Earth.
@SpotifyCares Im getting an ad that is as misplaced for me as possible (another language and for the military) . Would it be possible to report back in the app somehow?
@SpotifyCares The buttons are too close to each other. Devs should add more padding / margin
@SpotifyCares Why do I have to register to vote?
Also, why does the limit exist in the first place? What's the justification?
@SpotifyCares specifically does this affect the NAD D7050 amplifier?
@SpotifyCares @515263 I am happy to read that it will not affect the NAD D7050! Yet it is weird communication. I received the same mail, but as I own a NAD D7050 it should not have been send. Also @515265 @86673 were surprised by your mail and are unaware that it excludes the D7050.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the obvious "tip" of saving them next time; i actually figured out a small hack to get them and was able to retrieve them anyway.
@SpotifyCares It was suggested,I don't listen to Charlie Puth or any related music.Its irritating that it plays non jazz while the playlist's Miles Davis.
@SpotifyCares Y'all fuckers should fix it k
@SpotifyCares Do you pinky promise?
@SpotifyCares It's working now, nvm. I tried a different browser and it was the same issue.
@SpotifyCares Awesome! This is exactly the stuff I love to look at. Surprised its not advertised more.  TYSM!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s, didn't update the iOS since that is notoriously messing up iPhones that aren't the new one. Might be my wifi tho
@SpotifyCares It was as if the wifi was blocking Spotify but it's a network I use daily so it was weird
@SpotifyCares Hm it's my work network maybe they have something.... I'll try again tomorrow and hopefully it will be better!
@SpotifyCares It worked 🤗
@SpotifyCares ok figured out how to manually make one, is that how it's supposed to work?
@SpotifyCares Yes, I get the "This song is not available, if you have the file you can import it." error.. both online or if I "download" the song .
@SpotifyCares Of course, can I send it via a DM ? Appreciate the help!
@SpotifyCares thanks!
@SpotifyCares I figured out how to do it on my phone, but I'm still having trouble with the Web Player.
@SpotifyCares just curious
@SpotifyCares This is the Spotify app on a MacBook running Sierra. I believe I am running the most updated version. It fixed itself somehow
@SpotifyCares It worked, thank you!
@SpotifyCares its ok i have you in chat from your website now thanks
@SpotifyCares Done. There's growing discontent in the comments. You may want to get this one pushed through!
@SpotifyCares So I've been hacked? That's reassuring...

I tried to link my Facebook through the app a few days ago, has this caused it do you think?
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/cOqlIbMS3y
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/hcmBd1Eolx
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/A3pUA4Vbzi
@SpotifyCares No album content though.
@SpotifyCares Hi! As soon as I run the program the laptop freeze, I always have to restart it. I'm using W10. Version 1.0.64.399.g4637b02a
@SpotifyCares I have already reinstalled multiple times, but it always happens. Not really sure what's happening with it.
@SpotifyCares I used to do it with CCleaner. Seems to be running ok now. Thanks for the help!
@SpotifyCares I'm using Windows 10 tho the issue has been already fixed .p
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the tip
@SpotifyCares so old address is no more. Since it was created you started to connect Spotify to FB. Now I need to change e-mail, pswrd is :(
@SpotifyCares I did a couple times and it still didn’t switch!
@SpotifyCares That didn't address the issue however after logging out and back in everything appeared again. Crisis averted!
@SpotifyCares Sure! iPhone 6s+ 11.0., 8.4.25.906.

I just ended up texting myself to get out of it.
@SpotifyCares (i have premium) I can’t listen to them? I was thinking maybe it didn’t work offline but I don’t know
@SpotifyCares So I added some covers of ny fav artist to spotify, and i tried to sync it with my phone but when I try to listen to them offline
@SpotifyCares Every song on said playlist is a different artist
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/oKwRfL4VNg
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you nice to know someone cares 😌
@SpotifyCares Good job, team. We did it. https://t.co/tXqLjfO35u
@SpotifyCares Now this. Please care for me. https://t.co/1FcBqmXIaL
@SpotifyCares I'll give it a go!
@SpotifyCares Well the first thing I would recommend is to stop playing ads right after pressing skip. I get that there needs to be ads.
@SpotifyCares Nevermind, that was only for the time capsule playlist. I like the UI, will this be default in the future?
@SpotifyCares I was playing an album on shuffle that had all but one song left. It’s also happened on playlists with more than 100 songs.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Please let me know if I need to do something. It’s pretty jarring to be listening to soft music to relax and suddenly be blasted by Maroon 5.
@SpotifyCares I hope there is a more accesible payment like thru telecom so we can access it easily, I'm really a broke kid ☹
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares I’m using an iPhone 8 Plus with iOS 11.1 and Spotify version 8.4.25.906.
@SpotifyCares I just deleted and reinstalled the app. It seems to be working fine now. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares I’ve already paid for 1 month premium subscription today. But on the website it stated that my premium only last until 7nov17. What’s wrong?
@SpotifyCares I was trying to do the promo for the Hulu/student and I got charge 3 times
@SpotifyCares Disappointing considering ur devs had like a month to make it but thanks
@SpotifyCares Just wondering about the presale codes
@SpotifyCares Do you know if they've been sent out already?
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you!
@SpotifyCares Doesn’t seem to be working
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.1, v 8.4.25.906, macOS 10.13 v 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares i’d appreciate a reply before i demand my money back thanks
@SpotifyCares Yes, but songs like this one are missing: https://t.co/UJcZDxoSTF
@SpotifyCares Call up my boy @40192 right now and set up a day to get him in the studio to record some tracks for you guys!!! You won't regret it
@SpotifyCares music. Only once I got an error that said i couldn't add a song to my queue. Now the option just doesn't exist (2/2
@SpotifyCares Its all of your platform (apple, web , and android)
@SpotifyCares iOS11 (I haven’t updated to iOS11.1 .. yet) and the Spotify version is 8.4.25
@SpotifyCares That worked. Thank you! 🙌🏾
@SpotifyCares It’s ok, got to talk to live chat and they sorted it out, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Hi, thanks. This is happening across multiple devices and operating systems including a PC, a Mac running on Sierra, and an iPhone 6. Each has the most updated Version of Spotify available installed.
@SpotifyCares It does not.
@SpotifyCares Yes! MacBook Pro macOS Sierra 10.12.6 &amp; Spotify 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 / OnePlus 3T running Android 7.1.1 &amp; Spotify 8.4.23.784 armV7.
@SpotifyCares It happens on the devices I mentioned, I checked on the web player and it's fine there.
@SpotifyCares I have and it just continues to show that it is loading. https://t.co/8aJKhYxhz5
@SpotifyCares I’ve tried using Google Chrome (on phone and laptop), Safari (on my phone), and Internet Explorer (on my laptop). All with same result.
@SpotifyCares I got it. I think my university’s WiFi was blocking it. I finally tried it through mobile data and it worked. We good.
@SpotifyCares It does both. It takes forever to load and then I can't go past the browse page. I have to restart which takes forever then it works.
@SpotifyCares OS 10.10.5. Spotify 1.0.65.320.
@SpotifyCares yes to both of those, only the thirty or so songs that are already in the queue are shuffled, not the rest of the playlist
@SpotifyCares Cool, thanks for the reply. It's really more disruptive than fun though.
@SpotifyCares Yes, w/the Stranger Things 2 soundtrack and gladly w/nothing else so far. Here’s the screen. No big deal if it’s only for that album. Thanks https://t.co/IVXi443M3d
@SpotifyCares the problem resolved itself
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares Hi my Spotify isn’t showing on my iPhone lock screen anymore, can you help?
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.3 and Spotify version 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares Have tried but nothing works or it works for a little while but next time I open Spotify the same thing happens
@SpotifyCares Sounds good!
@SpotifyCares I’m locked out of my account 😟
@SpotifyCares Done. Nothing happened after I restarted my devices. :/
@SpotifyCares I logged out, reinstalled Spotify and logged back in. It’s still not working. Songs by other artists are playable.
@SpotifyCares I DM’ed you a screen capture that shows how my app reacts when I try to play a song by The xx.
@SpotifyCares I‘m using v. 8.4.22.515 on an iPhone 6s (iOS 11.1 beta 3) where the error occurred first. But it also happens in Spotify on macOS 10.12.
@SpotifyCares Just tried that. Nope. :(
@SpotifyCares Already done. It doesen‘t work.
@SpotifyCares It happens on WiFi, 4G and in Flight Mode.
@SpotifyCares update: songs by another artist turned out to be affected by that bug as well.
@SpotifyCares hope to hear from u soon...
@SpotifyCares Appreciate the assistance!! Big fan of @115888 !! 🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the info! So if I have ONLY my new iPod with @115888 premium, I can access all of my playlists offline? Just to clarify!
@SpotifyCares Todrick Hall’s Straight Outta Oz album has cracking sounds throughout the whole album
@SpotifyCares I am living abroad in the Netherlands for a year, so I’m assuming it’s because I’m using the internet here. Only my ads have changed.
@SpotifyCares @147836 I don’t think you get it.  I have received 10 more just this week.  Why is your system so broken?
@SpotifyCares @147836 In what world does your system have me as the writer of White Christmas, or Winter Wonderland? This is basic stuff.
@SpotifyCares @147836 I have sent @115888 @SpotifyCares and @14035 a screenshot of the records from the US Copyright office, since apparently you guys
@SpotifyCares @147836 @115888 @14035 can’t be bothered to hunt down all of this for yourselves.  I shouldn’t have to do your legwork. I am clearly not the only person currently
@SpotifyCares @147836 @115888 @14035 covering popular Christmas songs. It is INSANE that this has been going on since June and you haven’t addressed it.
@SpotifyCares I fixed it by making my own list. The hard part was to remember the order of all songs but I solved it yesyes
@SpotifyCares Around 1,300, I set it to download all yesterday. Could that be why?
@SpotifyCares I’m running version 8.4.25.906, and iOS 11.1, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Already turned that off as I read it was a battery killer - but I primarily use Spotify just from my phone so not via connect.
@SpotifyCares I'm using the app.
@SpotifyCares onePlus One , 8.4.26.770 armV7, Cyanogen OS bacon, android version 6.0.1.
@SpotifyCares When I'm on offline mode my connection shouldn't matter.
@SpotifyCares I saved that playlist with my 4g though waited for it to be complete then listened to it offline mode
@SpotifyCares it's all good now. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares I'm on the latest Spotify &amp; I just updated to the latest iOS version. Tried logging out &amp; back in &amp; most of the songs still won't play.
@SpotifyCares or Norwegian.
@SpotifyCares Which website should I link the song from?
@SpotifyCares I have indeed but I get nothing or an instrumental featuring an xylophone. Also what do you mean by song links?
@SpotifyCares No it didn't so I deleted the app and reinstalled it but everything in my library etc has gone 😔
@SpotifyCares yeah for some reason desktop won't fix. country set to US
@SpotifyCares spotify:album:4QUNWTw2FsIz722xjUjFJw
@SpotifyCares That’s truly absurd, but I know it’s not your fault. Thanks for the link/explanation.
@SpotifyCares Only “fix” is to close and reopen the app.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, iOS 11.1 (was also happening on iOS 11), Spotify version 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares Since it doesn’t happen every time I use the app, I’ll try it out during the day and get back to you guys with an update tomorrow!
@SpotifyCares someone contact mort's people!!! who can posthumously put his music on spotify!!!
@SpotifyCares Hey! I'm doing that everytime it gets to crazy. Helps only temporary for a short time  :-(
@SpotifyCares iOS version is 7.1.2 and SpotifyApp version is 6.5.0.1665
@SpotifyCares I've send you a DM!
@SpotifyCares Did all the steps you told me too, redownloaded all songs, today they got deleted again
@SpotifyCares Thanks but that's not really helpful. My app is up to date, I use Spotify every day, only download songs on my phone and my SD card is fine🤷
@SpotifyCares No worries now, it’s working! Must have been a problem on my end :)
@SpotifyCares i mean sometimes Spotify doesn’t update the song streams at the same time it usually does so i was worried something was happening
@SpotifyCares thanks a lot! 🤗
@SpotifyCares I wish that we can do payments with debit tho because no every student have credit card hhh
@SpotifyCares Hi. I've already paid for a 1 month premium subscription via an ATM yesterday but my account status is still 'free'? how do i solve this thx https://t.co/YMe6KTFTki
@SpotifyCares I've done it 🤓 got 0011! 🙋🏽 #happy
@SpotifyCares Noted &amp; thank u 💕
@SpotifyCares So when reputation is released on Friday it will not be on Spotify?
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much!
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares Like, I literally can't listen to Spotify atm. I need help. Anybody there?
@SpotifyCares Operating Syetem: MacOS Sierra v 10.12.6
Spotify: 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares @188 Now it’s very, very dull and boring (see attached) and there’s no disc image and no play button. It’s terrible! https://t.co/4ClqdWqh8r
@SpotifyCares Now it's working good, maybe since the update of the day. Thanks for help.
@SpotifyCares You have to log in to vote and I’m not a subscriber and won’t be, unless there’s an app for Apple TV. So, I guess, I’ll just have to wait and see... :)
@SpotifyCares @524277 What’s the point when you have 4000 votes from 4 years ago and you haven’t done it. Shows you guys don’t really look at the votes. Just there to make customers feel like they are involved but clearly not.
@SpotifyCares It's working on mobile and online now! 😀 #gremlins
@SpotifyCares Hi Spotify, this doesn't answer my question. I want to know if I can retrieve lost messages :(
@SpotifyCares I appreciate your response. And I will be sure to DM if I have issues again. Thanks so much.
@SpotifyCares Ummm been showing support of this idea since 2016 and ya'll still don't care. Smh change your Twitter handle.
@SpotifyCares Nvm it's back
@SpotifyCares Spotify version 8.4.25.906/happening since September 20th on my old iPhone 6, my new 8+ and iPad Pro. iOS versions 10, 11, 11.1, and 11.2.
@SpotifyCares Now I can’t log in but our network is fine https://t.co/83HBYez2BU
@SpotifyCares Router restarted. Only able to login if not connected to WiFi. IT dept says “it’s a known Spotify issue” 🙄🤷🏼‍♀️ Works fine on other WiFi’s.
@SpotifyCares Private WiFi. No issues w/home WiFi. My IT dept says it’s a “known Spotify issue”; but they are likely wrong. TY for troubleshooting
@SpotifyCares Logged me out and when I enter info it says  cfsr token is invalid. Version 11.3
@SpotifyCares Spotify logged me out. Sending message now
@SpotifyCares awesome! thanks for the fast reply
@SpotifyCares tried that but it’s still happening 😞 not as often tho so baby steps am I rite!!!!!
@SpotifyCares Can you help me close my Free account?
@SpotifyCares It didn't help, I'm using the mobile version. Android
@SpotifyCares Absolutely do it! Thank you!
@SpotifyCares I loved it 😭😭😭 RIP touch preview
@SpotifyCares Entered Discover UI on desktop on (Swedish) user "zao", get unavailable album recommended https://t.co/18LNaXLtcl
@SpotifyCares Defeats the point a bit when all you can do is go look for another source.
@SpotifyCares "Ooh, interesting album". "Oh... nevermind then, waste of space." https://t.co/Er7SuxXjUF
@SpotifyCares Yes, they are.
@SpotifyCares 😱 thx
@SpotifyCares It works now - thank you! :) have a great day
@SpotifyCares They don’t scroll through. As you can see all it says is ASAP mob when the track is playing
@SpotifyCares they were missing altogether, but are now all un-downloaded which happens often and is a bit shit for a paying customer 👎
@SpotifyCares thanks for the help and quick response.
@SpotifyCares Yes, I'm connected all the time. The exact message is "You are currently set to offline"
then "Please go online to connect to Spotify"
@SpotifyCares hkosev at gmail dot com
@SpotifyCares Device: Nexus 6p (Android 7.1)
@SpotifyCares Oh, sorry for bothering you I just uninstalled it and installed it again. I was able to download it now
@SpotifyCares Cool, thanks!
@SpotifyCares I want my paypal account credited back as I never authorized any of this.
@SpotifyCares They also synced 3 iPhones as recent as yesterday 11/6/17 and I have never owned an iPhone in my life
@SpotifyCares Well I love the feature on the PC app where I can see what my friends are listening to. Can we get that on the mobile app too? It's great
@SpotifyCares Thanks CP I did that straight away and haven't seen the same issue since.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I'm using a Nexus 5X running Android 8, Spotify version 8.4.26.770 armV7
@SpotifyCares Also the sound quality sounds extremely worse on my note 5 than on my s6. Any reason for this?
@SpotifyCares Spot8fy version 8.4.26.770 armv7

Android version 6.0.1
@SpotifyCares this did not work
@SpotifyCares Here you have it: https://t.co/OvwXkCeJSN This song doesn't have featured artists except @6713 😜💖
@SpotifyCares iPhone X, running 8.4.25.906, and I have an Echo and an Echo Dot, both of which were possessed at different times last night
@SpotifyCares yep it’s the default on both !
@SpotifyCares I'm using https://t.co/qFajrXA2Px. On my FB account: Melissa Lagerburg. Its not working on any PC/Laptop so I guess it is really my acc
@SpotifyCares both do not work :( i dont understand why my sisters account does work haha. has it something to do with permission maybe?
@SpotifyCares the problem is i dont wanna lose my playlists which are online, i dont have a premium account. thats why im not just deactivating my whole acc
@SpotifyCares Already received the payment receipt and already tried logging in and out
@SpotifyCares Still not working :(
@SpotifyCares My mastercard dont have enough balance anymore. What to do?!
@SpotifyCares So i decided to continue it at home but when I got home, I was already charged but no premium yet and I cant repeat the process because..
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thank u!
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/KH5y10zEI6
@SpotifyCares MBPr, macOS 10.13.1, latest version of Spotify. It's been happening since macOS 10.13 was released, more details: https://t.co/KeoOrVYOj8
@SpotifyCares Correct, can also cause kernel panics. Tried using NVIDIA drivers, reset NVRAM, disabling both GPU rasterization and accelerated 2D canvas.
@SpotifyCares And the song is not available in the list anymore! #help
@SpotifyCares I️ was using Firefox
@SpotifyCares i am using oneplus 5, android 7.1.1 and latest spotify version 8.4.26.770 armv7

@SpotifyCares yes on my 3 android devices
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!
@SpotifyCares Thank you!❤️
@SpotifyCares Less ads starting now or else imma start gettin up in that ass!!!
@SpotifyCares I don’t know how I haven’t noticed already haha thanks 💕
https://t.co/rGJpBnZalw
@SpotifyCares That's not really what I'm talking about. I like some of these songs but they're not new to me anymore. Maybe only exclude from discover?
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares At first it wuld just show it's processing 4 like 10 mins bt now it's doing this ! I have to click on the I am not a robot again n again! https://t.co/gMbowCGVkF
@SpotifyCares It's still doing the same! https://t.co/w2x2J73hF1
@SpotifyCares Laptop Dell, windows 10, Google chrome, wifi 4g network, and another device moto g 5plus
@SpotifyCares Nope
@SpotifyCares I'll do that :) Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Nope. Just tried incognito as well. Same issue.
@SpotifyCares it works now!
@SpotifyCares Using this thread to ask if I could get a Rap Caviar phone case - it looks so good, and I hope to have helped during downtime once 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
@SpotifyCares Aiight, but yo - hook a dude up for helping as well tho 👀
@SpotifyCares @527690 Same issue as well. Chrome (59.0.3071.115), Mac. Web browser version.
@SpotifyCares Hi guys I got on the live chat and they sorted it out for me so it’s all good now!
@SpotifyCares majid jordan
@SpotifyCares Force closing the app hasn't helped, I'll reboot shortly
@SpotifyCares uninstalled spotify and reinstalled it, no luck, works on my Mac, not on my iPhone :/
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/HIHaWFa5se
@SpotifyCares works fine on MacOS on the same network https://t.co/vcc3MlkxUL
@SpotifyCares Tested on an iPad Air 2 with latest update an no issues, same network as my iPhone 7 but no luck there sadly https://t.co/mkILm7Ju8e
@SpotifyCares the issue has no surfaced on Mac OS, my iPhone and Mac Spotify desktop client can no longer play Grimes https://t.co/ZdVTYh5YeI
@SpotifyCares All working now! Pass my thanks on to your tech people https://t.co/3ef66s6dvG
@SpotifyCares issue happens regardless of connection, another device on same network does not have the problem
@SpotifyCares None the only thing that happens is any music stops playing
@SpotifyCares Hi, on my laptop its only 1 year old and have sky fiber max internet
@SpotifyCares Thanks so much!
@SpotifyCares I’ve yet to hear from anyone at Spotify.   That’s another reason why I switched my streaming to another source.  Terrible service
@SpotifyCares usa
@SpotifyCares Hi - it says my email is no longer attached to an account. Ahhhhhh! HELPPPPPP!
@SpotifyCares Awesome thanks
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/IE7No4r9jZ
@SpotifyCares It solved! Thanks
@SpotifyCares I've tried that and have read people have had the same issues for years.
@SpotifyCares It has now
@SpotifyCares It does but it's something I do regular so we'll see how it goes.
@SpotifyCares Again, shows albums saved but not downloaded, and I had to log out just to get this.
@SpotifyCares Sounds awesome!
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares #sadtimes 😢
@SpotifyCares No, it happens randomly every day and it continues even after doing all that.
@SpotifyCares I already did that though
@SpotifyCares Hurry up before your customers move to Apple Music 😉
@SpotifyCares Wooo thanks! It was sticking on the loading screen, I'm not sure what happened but I reset my phone and everything is back to normal 👏🏻
@SpotifyCares Done
@SpotifyCares Works today 👍
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares thank you so much for your help!
@SpotifyCares Actually unplugging one of the Echos reset everything. So far so good! :-)
@SpotifyCares Actually think it was the device. I showed it Who’s The Boss and didn’t even need Tony Danza or Alyssa Milano.
@SpotifyCares I sent you guys a DM.
@SpotifyCares Aye av put mi word in thanks x
@SpotifyCares Whatever GT! I see how it is. (If its not coming across, Im joking 😏😁) I’m not joking about an Apple Watch app tho, hurry that up! 😆 Ineed⌚️
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 iOS 11.0.2 Spotify 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares I have tried this several times but it does not work
@SpotifyCares Both
@SpotifyCares I have just tried it yet it still hasn’t worked
@SpotifyCares How long is this going to take
@SpotifyCares nope, it only happens on my laptop. i have to force quit it a few times for it to work on my laptop. im on the latest os mac sierra.
@SpotifyCares Nope!
@SpotifyCares nevermind, didnt check the top bar. 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares So basically I can't get them back. WHY PUT IT ON YOUR SERVICE IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT MIGHT GET PULLED? Not a good business model.
@SpotifyCares Any chance this will be changed to allow more songs?
@SpotifyCares Hey thanks for getting back! A laptop restart seems to have fixed it and turns out it was all my audio not just Spotify. 🤗
@SpotifyCares @530693 I didn’t know you had to listen to them all day plus .. I hope they have tickets Friday!
@SpotifyCares I just want to explore the sonic cosmos, why you gotta do me like this
@SpotifyCares Grazie
@SpotifyCares Not sure. I noticed it today. I think it was working last week, but can't confirm. Just checked, and iTunes has the same issue, apparently.
@SpotifyCares I don't have any other to try. No updates available. Seems to be a system issue, though, not necessarily Spotify itself. (Unless Spotify is somehow stopping the media keys from working system wide, even when the desktop app isn't running.)
@SpotifyCares Correction. There is a system update showing now that wasn't before. I'll try updating that later and see if that fixes it. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares macOS 10.13.1 update seems to have solved the issue. Thanks again!
@SpotifyCares That didn't fix it. The play/next/previous keys still don't work. Tried the keys on both my external keyboard and the built-in one.
@SpotifyCares It happened 2 times so I deleted and reinstalled the app and it did it again
@SpotifyCares (Spotify iOS app version 8.4.25.906, on iOS 11.1)
@SpotifyCares I also searched for help, but I literally have no idea and internet neither
@SpotifyCares Do you mean an other Internet access? Like, another Wi-Fi?
@SpotifyCares It began over a week ago. When I try to start, there is a "loading" sign, and then it breaks down. I can't see more than this
@SpotifyCares When I open my phone Spotify, it automatically finds this. Why isn't there a way to disable this? It's ridiculous!
@SpotifyCares My phone is always logged in. My issue is that it's replacing my currently listening playlist on my phone with the desktop one which I do not want it to do.
@SpotifyCares A song page loads, such as @21153's Wolves (https://t.co/Css786YWaa), and then... nothing. The main button even says "Pause". No sound, no time ticking to show it's attempting to play.
@SpotifyCares improvements... still does not help that i can predict the songs of what is goign to play next like im not even on shuffle.
@SpotifyCares Appreciate it 🤘
@SpotifyCares Another day of not working. Promoted brand new @35357 album from your browse page and it doesn't work? nahhhh https://t.co/B1VNBaeDO9
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/OTf0VnQ87v
@SpotifyCares  Ill stick with free @115888 and no @115940 .. thanks tho.
@SpotifyCares and the spotify/hulu "bundle" is only good for students?  And doesnt work for those that pay full price?
@SpotifyCares Sony Xperia XZ with android and Acer aspire with Windows 10.
@SpotifyCares okay, thanks!
@SpotifyCares btw I followed your instructions and it seems to have stopped happening, tho I've been out of town for a couple days

ty!
@SpotifyCares It works again.
@SpotifyCares Galaxy J7, Phone, Version 8.4.25.771
@SpotifyCares Just wanted you to clarify that. Thanks! 🎧❤️
@SpotifyCares Hi! Did you remove the option to share what I'm listening to on Spotify to Facebook? Can't see my activity on facebook log anymore.
@SpotifyCares Interesting number. Why 3333?
@SpotifyCares Been on it for 2 years ...
@SpotifyCares It's 1.0.66.478.g1296534d on macOS High Sierra. But I've noticed similar things with the iOS version too.
@SpotifyCares i can't listen to it... i'll just wait till it's tomorrow ((greetings from the past (USA)))
@SpotifyCares Not entirely sure what version at the moment.. Using an iPhone, T-Mobile
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/Ep5oGMa1K1
@SpotifyCares Hey so this doesnt count if ive been listenin the albums offline sing day 1 😢
@SpotifyCares Hmmm so how do you judge offline playlists lol. Its ok i guess..
@SpotifyCares fans and I are very eager to hear #Reputation this friday at spotify
@SpotifyCares will it ever be available again?
@SpotifyCares thanks, because it's really weird to have a username consisting of random numbers and letters
@SpotifyCares No Movies
@SpotifyCares Hey I figured it out thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your service!
@SpotifyCares It does, but pass along that feedback as well. Really enjoyed it.
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares The message i get is "This song is not available. If you have the file on your computer, you can import it."
@SpotifyCares Work desktop, personal laptop and cell phone.
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Anytime I exit the app in and listen to a video or something else I have to restart the app in order to have any music play and sometimes it just randomly happens without me even listening to anything else
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, Ios 11, and spotify 8.4.25
@SpotifyCares I have already tried this a couple of times but I will try again and let you know
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you
@SpotifyCares I tried that... didn’t work :/
@SpotifyCares Yes! Full Moon by EXID and Block B- Montage
@SpotifyCares Usa i believe
@SpotifyCares Hey Spotify! That doesn't address my issue. I want to not be deaf, not change quality settings or mess around with an equalizer.
@SpotifyCares Weezer and imagine dragons I can't get anything to play from.
@SpotifyCares I've tried that. Tried uninstalling, reset, installing again too.
@SpotifyCares Ya, sure. https://t.co/ys4OUKF6bn
@SpotifyCares Dell Latitude E7240, Windows 10, App version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Yeah, I did that already on another Spotify chat case. It didn't work. https://t.co/xuWmOOeURC
@SpotifyCares Hey JU, I just uninstalled and reinstalled the Spotify app on my iPhone and it didn't play @146177.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Maybe rename it Cohabitant Plan?
@SpotifyCares Using the latest version of Spotify on MacBook Pro I do have a picture of an example https://t.co/vyAYPoJ0q4
@SpotifyCares MacOS Sierra version 10.12.6
@SpotifyCares Awesome. Love my Spotify bbs. Keep up the good work.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! it's working now!!! if i encounter a problem again, i will DM you guys! cheers! 😊
@SpotifyCares I believe in you guys! It’s just something I’ve always thought would be cool and I keep clicking on my fiends like I can say “cool tune” or thumbs up or whatever and then get sad about it. 😔
@SpotifyCares If I need to start a groundswell to push the boulder up the mountain, let me know. https://t.co/7jQqdOPjg7
@SpotifyCares Thank you I read it and it seems like it’s not coming back right or will you guys be bringing it back later on after adjustments ?
@SpotifyCares Thank you !
@SpotifyCares tell me how to do screenshot on chrome
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/RggH3V4v4f
@SpotifyCares This is reponse no matter what artist/playlist i select. Everything works fine on phone. Laptop is selected aa dwvice
@SpotifyCares I'm not on the App. I run spotify premium on my laptop w/windows 10 and chrome
@SpotifyCares Thanks JL, but could you pls tell your folks up top that ya can't remove a feature due to 'low engagement' and replace it with nothing :/
@SpotifyCares Saw this tweet. All the artists he mentions are also not playing for me. https://t.co/lyib4q2Pv6
@SpotifyCares I have changed country right before the weekend (geographically, not in settings). Could it have anything to do with it?
@SpotifyCares Both desktop and mobile. Seems to be on a per-artist basis. E.g. Grouplove, Weezer, Cage The Elephant and more don't work, others fine.
@SpotifyCares Songs are disappearing off of the albums I️ have saved and downloaded and aren’t saving when I️ go back to the artist to re-save the albums
@SpotifyCares so it's happened again. not working in chrome (incl incognito) or firefox.  i go to playlist. hit play. nothing. also greyd out play button.
@SpotifyCares afraid of .... what ?
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares LMK if there's a program to accept community contributions. We all just want a better music player.
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares I just want to know that your dev team is aware how flakey Spotify has become, and is improving the platform as a whole
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares is there any way I can track this or other bugs? I honestly don't care about this one in particular...
@SpotifyCares Spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02, macOS, MacBook Pro early 2015. Log file, if it helps:  https://t.co/xBbNmEI9TP.
@SpotifyCares "Song is not available" in the blue bar. Do you have a public bug tracker? I have more.
@SpotifyCares The previous URL is the only content that needs to be removed from the other Antwon’s profile.
@SpotifyCares I hope so because I miss playing @70874  &amp; @70875  X factor songs
@SpotifyCares Cheers. I’m loving your service. Will you ever have music videos  like Apple Music?
@SpotifyCares Cheers
@SpotifyCares I open the app, click on a song and it doesn't  play :(. The lower bar doesn't even appear.
@SpotifyCares I've done all of that. It was working fine two hours ago 😣
@SpotifyCares It's a little out dated
@SpotifyCares I try to shuffle in playlist and it really doesn't play randomly, plays the same artist almost continuously. Don't know what connect is
@SpotifyCares From my phone via Bluetooth connection.
@SpotifyCares The most recent versions of both
@SpotifyCares I have no clue I just played my song and as soon as it finished it wouldn’t go to ththe next song and the playlist just ended
@SpotifyCares That fixed it thnx
@SpotifyCares Oh the angst 💆🏽‍♀️
@SpotifyCares So the Morning After, turns out I didn’t make the algorithm 😥😓😥😓
@SpotifyCares Merci!
@SpotifyCares It keeps happening.. https://t.co/U8inmFFomq
@SpotifyCares it has been fixed now is what i meant
@SpotifyCares the ad stopped after i played a song on my phone and instead of my computer and reset the ad, it didn't stop playing.
@SpotifyCares @115888 help
@SpotifyCares No the app didn't crash which is why I'm confused
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares keep* on
@SpotifyCares Windows 10 Home, 1709, Os build: 16299.64

Spotify : 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf 

Would start to use 30+% CPU after playing a song, would stop when I logged off and would start again when logging in back in.
@SpotifyCares PC: 17 6700k, RX 480, 16GB, 64 bit
@SpotifyCares @AskPlayStation But this is the thing, my Spotify is not showing being linked with anything. Is there a way to create a new account and transfer over playlists, etc?
@SpotifyCares I'm currently using ver. 8.4.26.770 armV7 on OnePlus 3 with Android 7.1.1. I saw 2 cases like mine on the internet.
@SpotifyCares Clearing cache and using incognito window aren't working. :-(
@SpotifyCares Honestly I’ve been hearing that for six months now and at this point I feel like my chain’s been yanked. If not after six months, then when?
@SpotifyCares K. https://t.co/P56tqzyXAh
@SpotifyCares Hey, it’s me, ya boy back again.
okay not gonna lie @SpotifyCares I didn't actually see this coming, but thank you for the aquarium music. Also I will not cancel my Premium https://t.co/CFN46PiE4P
@SpotifyCares @16134 problem solved
@SpotifyCares @16134 i'm having the same problem that i had 2 days ago where i'm stuck a track
@SpotifyCares well i emailed you guys, can i DM you through here. i deleted my facebook and cant log into my spotify. my fb account is already permanently deleted, so i cannot reactivate.
@SpotifyCares I tried that yesterday and it didn’t work.
@SpotifyCares I use Spotify on my iPhone and I have the latest update for it.
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares i want @115888 and @125633 to follow me 😂
@SpotifyCares I’ve tried to download the most recent update but it won’t download
@SpotifyCares we’re all good I fixed the problem and the update downloaded. thanks for the help!
@SpotifyCares I could be a hero
@SpotifyCares I tried to login w/ Facebook, it says I don't have an account - I try to create an account, it says I have an account - Rinse repeat. :(
@SpotifyCares yes. my username is geetyakbari
@SpotifyCares its been ongoing since 2013 but definitley still will contribute
@SpotifyCares but if the idea was introduced in 2012 and were still waiting how soon is “soon”? https://t.co/35KsppzX3I
@SpotifyCares No point. I've cancelled the family subscription. I'd rather share the 1 account with my wife than try to jump through those sign-up hoops.
@SpotifyCares Will do - thanks.
@SpotifyCares Yep, aware of that.  My question was about visibility.  Perhaps if you started publishing details labels would be less inclined to remove?
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I’ll keep listening!
It kept recommending "suggested tracks" until it was finally onto xxxtenacion. Pls @SpotifyCares stop adding new features
@SpotifyCares I downloaded the app again. It's working fine as it is now. thank you anyways! 😊
@SpotifyCares Feels like being ignored 😑
@SpotifyCares Yes tries it several times, still no use
@SpotifyCares I don't have another SD card
@SpotifyCares Samsung galaxy S6
Android Nougat
Version 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares Yeah for sure, it's usually bang-on correct. Just thinking it would help the rec engine to know what we really hate as well as like. Thx!
@SpotifyCares also I'm unable to change my country using the webplayer
@SpotifyCares This is only happening on my mobile app. Works on PC. When clicking on one of his songs, nothing happens at all. No specific errors.
@SpotifyCares @16134 What do you mean by number 7? Like no swear words in the song names? The song lyrics? Is there a list of forbidden words?? https://t.co/pAWKkd967c
@SpotifyCares also mic drop and go go
@SpotifyCares i'm using windows 10 and the free version spotify
@SpotifyCares 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 i don't know if this is the latest version or not
@SpotifyCares Or can you make it an option? Daily Mixes have a good selection and sometimes I gotta run a song back once or 5 times https://t.co/92U1YudN0e
@SpotifyCares Can't send a dm
@SpotifyCares I can not remember I have EVER listened to the Scorpions on Spotify, but I may be wrong on that. It’s also very far from the usual styles I listen to, that’s why I was so surprised. OTOH, I often like out-of-band suggestions from Spotify.
@SpotifyCares @537000 Reputation?
@SpotifyCares Done!
@SpotifyCares I opened a legit ticket, aka, The Cuprit Monkey Problem.  BTW, your support email form was a bitch to find.  Might want to change that.
@SpotifyCares When I try to play a song nothing plays. But when I try to shuffle it says This song is not available. And the same after a few tries.
@SpotifyCares I have a premium account, not a student account
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/MfQzSu7P2S
@SpotifyCares its connected now but thank you
@SpotifyCares I also had an premium account, this should get you guys to actually care.
@SpotifyCares And i have tried to log out all offline devices this doesn't work, the password and email has been changed so i cant access my account.
@SpotifyCares Gift**
@SpotifyCares email added some months ago 😂
@SpotifyCares It crashes whenever I share any song, album, or playlist. I'll try a hard restart of my phone and see if that works.
@SpotifyCares Update, I restarted and the problem has persisted.
@SpotifyCares I just want my refund. I got charged twice and I still don't have access to my spotify account.
@SpotifyCares Hi! I appreciate the response. I press the songs, they turn black like this but nothing happens. any other artist and the music plays! odd https://t.co/l80aVcDCzJ
@SpotifyCares Im on an iPhone, running Spotify 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares did it, no improvement
@SpotifyCares Humble by Kendrick Lamar plays on and off ... Some days it does some days not
@SpotifyCares Not one song in this playlist plays ... https://t.co/jM4vOjcRIO
@SpotifyCares Nope ... Same ...
@SpotifyCares Nope still doesn't work ... Even deleted the com.spotify.music folder
@SpotifyCares iphone 6s, im using the updated spotify
@SpotifyCares 9029 last 4 numbers of my visa
@SpotifyCares I know that, thank you. But my point was: your app is free so there shouldn't be a freaking subscription.
@SpotifyCares I'm using the latest version on a Nokia 6 that has Nougat installed.
@SpotifyCares Nothing at all.

@SpotifyCares I just dumped the whole thing. I'd expect its your job to figure this out, isn't it. 
I'd expect some auto-updater left over garbage coupled with audio cache. But who knows
@SpotifyCares Back up to 1 gig already: appdata/local/spotify/data. v1.0.67.582.g19436fa3 win10.
@SpotifyCares I cannot. I had several replies on this issue by people experiencing the same data junk problem. You might wanna forward this to your software engineers.
@SpotifyCares Thanks a lot for the reply!! I've loved Spotify for years so keep up the good work! 👍
@SpotifyCares each password change has been to a 30+ char password with high entropy and only used on spotify, think this is a bug on your end
@SpotifyCares I also am getting an error when trying to log into my account to force logout all active sessions... password has been changed twice prior
@SpotifyCares I did it will I be charged again this month for switching to student? I paid for premium this month $9.99 and it ask for payment again $4.99
@SpotifyCares Thanks @SpotifyCares that link sorted me out!
@SpotifyCares DM sent!
@SpotifyCares Still waiting for a reply/solution
@SpotifyCares @147836 you already did! Helped me get my acct back but was told only way to get rid of “suggestions” is new account or tons of listening
@SpotifyCares @147836 Spotify’s value comes from its recommendations. If your system is going to recommend me something I don’t want (bc it’s not mine), why pay?
@SpotifyCares problem is I don't remember how I wrote my address since the format used in my city and the format used by Spotify are different
@SpotifyCares have all of the Jhene Aiko presale codes been sent out already? 😩
@SpotifyCares Samsung S8, Android 7.0, Spotify 8.4.22.857armV7 there is only Shuffle Play but no Play https://t.co/QmJ7rQ5Mdx
@SpotifyCares It usually happens everytime after i try to use the search function.
@SpotifyCares Haven't logged out,but restarting works just for a while. After an hour or so, it does the same.
@SpotifyCares A couple of weeks ago.
@SpotifyCares More than 400 GB.  I also don't use external music sources like iTunes on Spotify.
@SpotifyCares Thanks,  I'll try and let you know.
@SpotifyCares Mac OS 10.12, Spotify 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02. Sluggish response, extremely slow while loading/finding artists. I've already deleted caché.
@SpotifyCares Windows 10 and Android 7, it just doesn't seem to be what it used to be, takes a long time to load up
@SpotifyCares Listen, @115888.  It's not your recommendation engine that's the problem.  It's awesome.  What sucks is the boilerplate content 1/2
@SpotifyCares @115888 2/2 that I see when I open the app on the browse page.  Surely you know that "This is Pink", Top Dance Tunes and Deutschrap Royal aren't me
@SpotifyCares @115888 Seems you'd make more money for your artists by presenting relevant content everywhere.  3/4 of the content is currently irrelevant to me
@SpotifyCares @115888 You have my data, use it to serve me not the corporations that are promoting music I don't care about.
@SpotifyCares @16134 If you really cared you would stop charging my teenage daughter account when it was cancelled. and no phone number 2 call. 15.38/10.68/10.68
@SpotifyCares I’m a Premium user and I cloud play them until recently
@SpotifyCares Is there a way to only show that button if there is a device available?
@SpotifyCares So this button and this screen is always accessible? https://t.co/oqFdWANzNt
@SpotifyCares Hmm I thought it was an option I turned on. So even if I have NO DEVICES AVAILABLE the DEVICES AVAILABLE will still show up?
@SpotifyCares That feels like it doesn't make sense.
@SpotifyCares It takes large amounts of time to be ready to play music, is on a Mac mini 2017, OS Sierra, Spotify AB
@SpotifyCares 😐 still loading…
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares and my college is listed smh
@SpotifyCares AD*
@SpotifyCares Nope, and I also didn’t skip any songs
@SpotifyCares I mean on the app
@SpotifyCares kodasquirrel __email__ thank you!!
@SpotifyCares becky ann and my email is __email__
@SpotifyCares How long should it take? And why would one song out of an album have license issues but not the whole album?
@SpotifyCares Error code 3, but I've also changed my facebook password too just in case. But still it doesn't work.
@SpotifyCares I'm fairly certain it's possible on desktop still, it was a great way to play a general genre rather than it's sub-genre-specific playlists
@SpotifyCares It does meet all requirements. I’ve used a prepaid card many times previously. Not sure why they are suddenly not being accepted?
@SpotifyCares Other songs by other artists still work
@SpotifyCares Still don't see the option. Only monthly.
@SpotifyCares Ok I got it! However, there is no discount for buying a year. Really should change that. Increased revenue and commitment up front
@SpotifyCares Unless its gonna get me a few months of free premium. In which case I am extremely outraged.
@SpotifyCares Also could anyone verify that the spotify&lt;-&gt;shazam app keys are not compromised?
@SpotifyCares Would spotify share the IP addresses of all the devices that have access to my account? One of those accounts likes explicit french rap.
@SpotifyCares yo i think i fixed it my dudes. but ya that issue was kinda annoying. maybe look into it. tell ur dude Edwin W thanks for the help
@SpotifyCares I’ve done that already and its been weeks and I have yet to get an answer or the problem fixed
@SpotifyCares Finally got it fixed thx!
@SpotifyCares + but Spotify website still says I'm subscribed thru Vodafone. Does it take a while to cancel the premium or can I re-subscribe now? Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thanks - kinda annoying that I have to get my phone to stream Spotify music to a Chromecast Audio device. Would rather do it from desktop.
@SpotifyCares been told that you guys can help me transfer my old playlists from my current account to the new account that I want to make 2/2
@SpotifyCares Seriously i am a college prof and it annoyed me enough to switch to pandora :(mYou also repeat the same ad incessantly
@SpotifyCares We don't want to transfer over his playlists from my account until we sort this out. (also, is there an easy way to do that?)
@SpotifyCares Can we make it just the proper username everywhere?
@SpotifyCares found in u t&amp;c , i accepted a prev 30 day trial there4 it only offer 30. u shuld make very clear in mail so not waste my time n energy. :(
@SpotifyCares found, it was a email sent to my gmail direct from u. plz give ur email, so i can 4ward erroneous redirect offer.
@SpotifyCares I have voted for it and so have many others. It's the 10th top idea that hasn't been implemented and the 3rd that is marked as "Good idea".
@SpotifyCares It's been an active request for almost 6 years and should only take a matter of days, if that, to develop and implement.
@SpotifyCares only the 4 songs are avaible that they've already released but the rest aren't https://t.co/hvQ3IvTmsX
@SpotifyCares Thank you for coming thru with this 🙏🏼🙏🏼😊
@SpotifyCares Ok cool, it's just not only playlists and it's much easier to access under the artist bio like it used to be but thanks anyway :)
@SpotifyCares Aww, y'all are fine. I just think it'd be fun if 'daily mix 6' had fun names like 'durty hip hop sunsets' or 'glitter pixie dreamscape' 🤗
@SpotifyCares One by one. And I would have to do this each time I just to add one song.
@SpotifyCares It keeps wanting me to make a new playlist just to add one song to a playlist. So I would have to add the songs from the old playlist
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Samsung Galaxy s7
@SpotifyCares Okay. Here it is. https://t.co/nxFxBXLzBY
@SpotifyCares The solution that was given to me when I sent the DM was to transfer all of my old songs from an already existing playlist one by one
@SpotifyCares to a new playlist but I'm not even able to open my playlist to show me the list of all my songs so I can transfer them.
@SpotifyCares Should I completely cancel my account and restart it?
@SpotifyCares Crazy behavior. Uninstalled, reinstalled, launched the app for the first time, correct icons are there for a split second then back to this.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/rVT2YtkdAd
@SpotifyCares I am logging in through Facebook if that is somehow causing the problem.  I'm puzzled.
@SpotifyCares I'm on a Samsung S7 Edge.  Android 7.0.  Uninstalled the app, reinstalled, all icons come up for a split second, then back to basic 3 again
@SpotifyCares heklo
@SpotifyCares I don't mind the shuffle feature but not being able to play songs is a bit futile in terms of having the app. Thanks for the help tho!! 😊
@SpotifyCares It's very annoying I just want the playlist to play the songs in order (I have premium)
@SpotifyCares But he's not in the Univ. yet is in 2nd grade, does it mean he cannot access the promo?you should include teenagers also.he's a great fan!
@SpotifyCares Care to explain this odd design choice? 🤔
@SpotifyCares Oh, I see what it's doing. Getting duplicates because I have a file downloaded. Still, never seen this before &amp; I don't want instant search.
@SpotifyCares This is the error message I get every time I try opening Spotify app on the ps4, and yes but restarting doesn’t seem to help with the prob https://t.co/KI2IDcQtCZ
@SpotifyCares Sorry! Didn't see the fast response. IPhone 7. Latest ios. Can't volume up or down with screen locked. Also I can't press next music.
@SpotifyCares I am a premium member too, so it's not that either. My playlist simply skips over the all Usher songs.
@SpotifyCares I have already done that...along with tens of thousands of other people.  I would wage Spotify doesn’t care to add this feature...sad!
@SpotifyCares I got it to work, it was something I was putting in wrong
Wait now I have to cancel @SpotifyCares because i need something that works with my watch and I am legitimately sad. ☹️
@SpotifyCares @386047 what about this one? it isnt have the “new single” thing https://t.co/MPm1eNLuoX
@SpotifyCares plz help
@SpotifyCares Hey! I am using iPhone 6s with Spotify 8.4.22.515 Thank you!
@SpotifyCares No error, just when I press the shuffle play button to the Imagine Dragons album it does not want to play. The device is my iPhone 5SE
@SpotifyCares Restarting didn’t help either &amp; that’s what I did as well the first time.
@SpotifyCares Thank You!
@SpotifyCares I tried incognito (and guest, in case it was a plugin).  I guess I can try clearing cookies when I'm back in the office, but seems unlikely
@SpotifyCares I'll send you a screenshot via DM...
@SpotifyCares Plus it’s skipping every 10 seconds of each and every song
@SpotifyCares Username: kjgeir3mnqoatp8oq050jds7b
@SpotifyCares So I’d still have to download all my tracks again even though my app is up to date and I’ve only got one active offline device?
@SpotifyCares Says no Facebook linked, I can't us my email and Facebook doesn't work? When I try on the app it fails once I login to Facebook (2)
@SpotifyCares "Playback Failed" - Forces me to stop my work, go to iPad, reload Spotify, restart adverts, again. THAT is just BS. Feature, not a Bug? https://t.co/CbTtlC76mq
@SpotifyCares The android system
@SpotifyCares I don't know how to operate on this page. https://t.co/dUmGv2EUNk
@SpotifyCares It’s a feature that others have. You’re running an A/B experiment, and I’d like to be in the population that has the feature. Make sense?
@SpotifyCares It worked out in the end. Thank you! One question though, is there a way to unsync between devices under one account?
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/cxuUC4Rawy
@SpotifyCares Alright, I’ll do that. Thanks for the response!
@SpotifyCares macbook pro 15” 2017, macOS Sierra (10.12.6). Spotify desktop version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Please help. They are in my account doing who knows what. @115888 @117168
@SpotifyCares Um thanks
@SpotifyCares Yes thank you! I hVe to say ‘free’ Spotify is a bit of a con isn’t it. At every opportunity I’m prompted to upgrade and some features don’t
@SpotifyCares Tell that to my coworker who got an eye full of St. Vincent's pink-clad butt 😂 thanks for replying though!
If That Aint Country, Longhaired Redneck &amp; Willie, Waylon and Me are no longer on my playlist wtf is that @SpotifyCares @115888
@SpotifyCares Lenovo Thinkpad, Windows 10, Spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares To be clear, I just want to update the email address.
@SpotifyCares spotify:track:3U9HrZM2sAZhqdSvZMj2oq Everything from War on Drugs plus loads of other tracks and albums too... On both app and Mac.
@SpotifyCares Either the app won't launch, because the audio stream couldn't be initialized, or the app just keeps flipping back to "loading" every time I try to find something to play.
@SpotifyCares As Groove Music Pass users are being forced to switch over, I'd really hoped the app would work better on Windows 10 Mobile.
@SpotifyCares That's certainly an odd arrangement, given that Microsoft is shepherding their Groove Music Pass users to Spotify. Many of us still carry Windows 10 Mobile devices. Seems you'd want your new customers to have  good initial experience.
@SpotifyCares I am using the latest version of the app on Android. Stops approximately every 1.5 songs.
@SpotifyCares iphone se and spotify version 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares thanks 🙏🏽
@SpotifyCares yes all good !
@SpotifyCares Thanks for seeing this! Hopefully one day this may be a promotion because I’d be signing up ASAP!
@SpotifyCares and stop it from happening!
@SpotifyCares @188000 Are we still waiting for support on mac?
@SpotifyCares Heyy I am 😭😭😭 lemme get a codeeee https://t.co/s0zECqTdyC
@SpotifyCares Streaming. I tried to download and it did not work. Message on desktop says something like  "this track is not available at this time"
@SpotifyCares Sure, it’s a 6s, 11.0.3, 8.4.22...I can’t control the music outside of the app since the app updated yesterday
@SpotifyCares Welp...just tried that and it did show up on my lock screen again...maybe the old restart was just what I needed.
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares, and my family account was automatically switched to premium, also before it ended, and I had no hand in any of that.
@SpotifyCares thank you, i got it working just after i asked this LOL
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your reply! 

Receiver: Yamaha RX-A3050 | Speakers: Sony SA-NS500 (not sure if compatible but it will be great if they can be)
@SpotifyCares This was on both android and pc
@SpotifyCares I just today reinstated my student discount, that went fine and was able to watch hulu using it yesterday. When i try to link the two (cont)
@SpotifyCares Heres the popup i get https://t.co/Skib1PEdu5
@SpotifyCares Same issue, tried different browser and incognito
@SpotifyCares the picture change i mean
@SpotifyCares Nah I'm wondering how to get verified as a student since I live in Canada! Can you help?
@SpotifyCares Hey so when my phone is locked I press next and it’s just annoying because it beeps and I would rather it just be silent when I skip songs
@SpotifyCares I am using an iPhone 6s and the most recent update on app and iPhone software
@SpotifyCares Using Spotify 8.4.23.784 on an Android phone with Android 6.0.1. - I dont have the Problem while using Spotify on my Macbook...
@SpotifyCares I am paying 10€/month and I suddenly can not listen to all the music anymore!? :(
@SpotifyCares Yes that's not cool. Can't agree more. Nope. Everything is fine on my side. Downloading everything again so... Grrrr
@SpotifyCares ..tried to sign in using facebook. But since I had a changed email address it just created a new account. My old email address is deleted
@SpotifyCares ASSUMPTIONS PEOPLE BELIEVE ABOUT FAMILIES: THEY LIVE TOGETHER, NEVER MOVE, AND ALWAYS FIT THE NUCLEAR FAMILY MODEL.
@SpotifyCares is my family too NON-TRADITIONAL for your BULLSHIT? Thank god my father doesn't work on CONTRACT. But fuck me for being AT UNIVERSITY.
@SpotifyCares I won't bother.

If the reduced-cost student version goes away, I'll just go back to pirating music and listening to Pandora.
@SpotifyCares This isn't about a "problem with my account" it's about you having a very broken understanding of what "families" are and how they operate.
@SpotifyCares I'd *like* to share a family account with my partner, but we don't share a physical address, plus there's that whole "but what if we move"
@SpotifyCares I find it, as a software engineer, *fucking shocking* that the concept that sometimes, addresses change is too hard for you to handle.
@SpotifyCares Legitimately, I have more leniency with *government forms* for error,as well. I've dealt with *typos on my ID* better than you can.
@SpotifyCares how fucking hard is it? "oooh we updated a line in a fucking database". Amazon handles it JUST FINE but you're like "make a new account"
@SpotifyCares But *why*. Why do that when *amazon* doesn't need that? Why can't you *change* your address? Why do errors require account *destruction*?
@SpotifyCares that's not an answer. Why can't I change my address for a family account? Why do you have this rigid, brittle system?
@SpotifyCares It's the iPhone 7+ that I'm using and iOS 10.3.2
@SpotifyCares There isn’t any error messages and it’s all of his songs
@SpotifyCares But i did use my account so please help me.
@SpotifyCares It would keep showing "the username you provided is not associated with an active Spotify accout"
@SpotifyCares Every time it freezes like this, the only way to fix it is to kill the battery. The Spotify app always greys out and I can use the screen.
@SpotifyCares I want to be able to directly message songs to my friends through Spotify
@SpotifyCares Taken care of thank you
@SpotifyCares I was worth a shot. :D
@SpotifyCares On The CDs conversa was written something like "contains never before versions of the two songs".
@SpotifyCares Cheers! You'll have a very happy customer here if you do!
@SpotifyCares @549077 I didn't get one :(
@SpotifyCares __email__ y signed in with facebook
@SpotifyCares I’ve been listening for 3 years excuse me pls
@SpotifyCares Why? I just told you that's a feature I'd like to see.
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I’ve been getting duplicate presale codes for other artists I haven’t listened to that much, weird
@SpotifyCares Not without pissing off the roommates, but I can tell you it started at work. Totally different network, different machine, same problem.
@SpotifyCares I think twitter will be faster than e-mail, English support is just as fine. Thnx.
@SpotifyCares Just dropped you a dm with the details. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares yes, tried both. neither helped.
@SpotifyCares Uninstalled and installed on both and sorry, still no Metallica :/
@SpotifyCares i don't recall the usernames but the emails are __email__ and __email__
@SpotifyCares what's DM?
@SpotifyCares Got my code and tickets! Thank you @115888!
@SpotifyCares Yes I did notice that, but I clicked it to minus the list and when I went back to see if that worked I still got suggested tracks

@SpotifyCares My phone is a Huawei P8 with 5.0.1 Android version.
Spotify 8.4.23.784
Thanks.
@SpotifyCares I do it, but doesnt work.
@SpotifyCares ... p.s.: i tried this using my 4G data and not the WiFi
@SpotifyCares will do, in the meantime I installed Spotify (v8.4.23.784) on my phone (android v6.0.1) and I'm having the same issue..
@SpotifyCares sorry, I'm using the workplace network right now... (to specify, I get the "This song is not available" error message)
@SpotifyCares I restarted and logged out and back, and no luck (I had already tried to reinstall the software, btw)
@SpotifyCares hi! I'm having the problem in two different laptops running on windows 10 with spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Ah okay, will try that!
@SpotifyCares Hey! Did the things, even reinstalled the app, but the problem persists :(
@SpotifyCares Nope, it just doesn't play. If I'm playing something else, that stops and the playing bar with the current song and controls disappear.
@SpotifyCares Well, you know :') But did it again with the instructions, no difference. Checked my laptop, same problem. https://t.co/Cga18eiqO0
@SpotifyCares BUT! I have an error message here https://t.co/NzzHqAEmhu
@SpotifyCares Yes and I’m using an iPhone with the app and I’m using 8.4.22 version
@SpotifyCares Nothing happened but I did notice it is only this specific playlist that doesn’t show the playback bar all the others show it 🤔🤔🤔 https://t.co/EPDgUy9EHT
@SpotifyCares Nah, it's all good.
@SpotifyCares I have about 50+ songs of a completely diff genre in my song list, been actively thumbs upping stuff on the radio and discover 2 try fix mix
@SpotifyCares This does not help.. I actually think it is bugged as it hasnt changed in weeks with only 1 song related that I have no disliked and removed
@SpotifyCares Galaxy s7 active, andriod https://t.co/wtAZr6nNUP
@SpotifyCares 7.0 and it's on different songs but only when playing thru speakers.
@SpotifyCares I'm using my phone speaker. But if I do Bluetooth it's fine
@SpotifyCares On top of that you messed up Hulu for my next month.  What is this?
@SpotifyCares hereๆๆๆๆ https://t.co/uGibEIJi2L
@SpotifyCares i dont have an account yet im trying to register a new account
@SpotifyCares yes, I am running Android OS 6.0 and have much more than the minimum space requirements.
@SpotifyCares okay great, I was wondering b/c I heard that on 10 inch tablets that the app wont force you to shuffle..However, my screen is 9.6 inches
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/8yCTisYAUj
@SpotifyCares Nope, no messages or indicators. Another artist made the list too. So far, it's Bon Iver, The National, and Grizzly Bear
@SpotifyCares Tracks from both artists listed but not present and skipped when played through any artist radio.
@SpotifyCares I’ve already created a new free account, want to be sure I don’t get charged twice for the month. Trying to get rid of Facebook link.
@SpotifyCares Every month. I get terrible reception where I work. I need the downloaded versions. This is getting out of hand.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/pPseUUQ00P for instance and I'm in the USA.
@SpotifyCares I even uninstalled and reinstalled Spotify.
@SpotifyCares I even tried that.
@SpotifyCares Both
@SpotifyCares I also connected with my Facebook. I removed Spotify from my FB account but still its not helping. tell me how to login with my JUST email?
@SpotifyCares thank you for replying, I really hope they bring it back since i often listen to it
@SpotifyCares but it does this for every song no matter what
@SpotifyCares it says that the song isn't available but if i have the track on my computer i can import it.
@SpotifyCares it did not. :/
@SpotifyCares I did the reinstall on mobile, that's where the problem happens. 
I did it but it still isn't working.
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares I am not, when I click on his music the play bar on the bottom just goes away. if I try to queue it, it says "Cannot queue this content."
@SpotifyCares Please go look at the post in Spotify forum I linked in my last Tweet. It's all explained there.
@SpotifyCares And I am not alone, as you can see in the forum thread. You need to get the Spotify devs to look at this ASAP. Please escalate.
@SpotifyCares @550588 I have been having the same problem for a few months now and still don't have an account :(
@SpotifyCares Sure, I’m using an iPhone 6s, iOS 11.0.3, and Spotify version 8.4.22 🤓
@SpotifyCares Awesome yeah, I’ll try it out right now, and I’ll let you know if it works. Thanks! 🤓
@SpotifyCares It worked thank you so much! ♥️🤓🎶🎧
@SpotifyCares It’s really odd because then my app will start working normal again. Is there a way that this can be fixed. Thank you! 🤓
@SpotifyCares You realise that opt out consent is likely not legal? See e.g. https://t.co/VfQEan0XIF
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares Iphone 6, ios 11.0.3 sadly, 8.4.22 spotify
@SpotifyCares It works! I’ll come back to you if Apple decides to make me crazy again
@SpotifyCares I've logged out and logged back in. Crashes when searching. Also tells me that I'm offline when trying to bring up menu to add to playlist
@SpotifyCares Hi there. Already tried that twice.
@SpotifyCares Works fine on everything else. Web browser. It's just the app that won't work
@SpotifyCares Already did. 
Certain songs are not playing when I click on them. Different artist. Different songs
@SpotifyCares No error message, just doesnt play.
@SpotifyCares Already have done all of that.
@SpotifyCares Sent a DM
@SpotifyCares It’s the new BECK album if that helps!
@SpotifyCares ISO 11.0.3. iPhone 6s Spotify 8.4.22.515.
@SpotifyCares Issue happens whether downloaded or download removed and playing via data. Nothing.
@SpotifyCares I’ve removed and re-added. Nothing. Old downloads are fine!
@SpotifyCares Done!
@SpotifyCares I’m using an iPhone 7 using iOS 11.3 and latest version of spotify.
@SpotifyCares Just this certain artist as far as I can tell. Literally everything else I’ve tried works.
@SpotifyCares That didn’t work either
@SpotifyCares that did not work
@SpotifyCares song that is playing disappears
@SpotifyCares the spotify version on the iphone is 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares Hi! It's working today, thanks anyways :)
@SpotifyCares Much appriciated! it works now.
@SpotifyCares No it shows up as if it's playing but the time bar just say 00.00 on both ends again it plays on my pc but not phone
@SpotifyCares I mean you aren't gonna fix it
@SpotifyCares ..but when I try to reset my password, it says I need to login with my facebook.
@SpotifyCares I wasn’t, you guys are trash
@SpotifyCares Spotify user directly.
@SpotifyCares No not at all
@SpotifyCares Yes, always do. Been on Spotify for years. Know that you have to listen to full ad.
@SpotifyCares The device is a huawei and the current version is 8.4.23.784 please help my music is suffering
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your attendion 👍🏻
@SpotifyCares 🤔What about previous songs I've played from the discover weekly playlist?
@SpotifyCares I Was On This Loading Screen From Since 10:40 PM https://t.co/VxMRc8GFqG
@SpotifyCares Ok. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Thanks https://t.co/M9zk72iCRU
@SpotifyCares Samsung J7 Prime, Android 6.0.1, version 8.4.23.784? it updated when i was sleeping. i used it prior the update.
@SpotifyCares hi! i did what was stated in the link, now it crashes when i try to log in
@SpotifyCares nope. i got this. :( https://t.co/XKXU2LBXiV
@SpotifyCares it seems to happen to my account only. I have it on my iPhone 7+ and my MacBook Pro retina. I use the same account and Britney doesn’t play.
@SpotifyCares It happens with wifi, 3G, 4G etc. i’ve tried logging out and back in, doesn’t work. tried deleting the app and it still doesn’t work. Look: https://t.co/90uG8rPPkZ
@SpotifyCares I rejoined premium a few months back and it's done it ever since. Worse the last month, this is the third week in a row.
@SpotifyCares None of the bullets are applicable. I guess I'll try reinstall and see if that works. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Haven’t lost my music since doing this. Deleted a couple of old devices off the list too maybe that helped. Cheers 👍
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6, iOS 11.1.2, Spotify 8.4.28
@SpotifyCares my spotify works fine. thanks
@SpotifyCares Great! Here's the info:
Device: LG G6
Android: 7.0
Spotify version: 8.4.23.784 armV7
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately, the problem still persists.

There is no error message if I click on a "The XX" song. It doesn't react at all.
@SpotifyCares Her you go: https://t.co/YWFmF3qc4g

The country is set to Switzerland.
@SpotifyCares It didn't unfortunately.
By the way, I've just tried to play the song on my desktop. It doesn't work, but at least there is an error message
@SpotifyCares "This song is not available. If you have the file on your computer you can import it."
@SpotifyCares What the H E C K does “Shuffle with Connect mean”?
@SpotifyCares Thanks veryyyyyy much!!
@SpotifyCares Hmmmm..... how does one get their hands on that??? (I don't have my emails enabled usually)
@SpotifyCares One month later... still waiting for some come back from you on this https://t.co/1IojWFo8Ds seems to me you guys don't care at all
@SpotifyCares 2 month later, what is your progress on resolving this bug?
@SpotifyCares Another month has gone by, pls give me news on the bugfix.. Spare me the PR bullshit pls
@SpotifyCares Its been like that for the past 5 years, i dont know why i expected anything else.. Pass that to your bosses please https://t.co/WpQ7Iiqdnk
@SpotifyCares Try to shuffle on artists "Rancid"; will get track "Ruby Soho" and many recent track mutliple times while nothing from their older albums.
@SpotifyCares Wow that response only took one hr, thank god I’m not paying.. oh wait I am paying, thanks for nothing I already solve it.
@SpotifyCares Hard to say but I just estimated 67 albums, which would be about 700 tracks...
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/SAARdHe7Q8
@SpotifyCares HELP PLZ I JUST WANT TO LISTEN TO KENDRICK LAMAR AND ST. VINCENT
@SpotifyCares Here is the email to the account __email__
@SpotifyCares I didn’t make one after it didn’t get me approved.
@SpotifyCares Just dloaded new Spotify and deleted this version. Problem solved!!🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 https://t.co/83lcCI1PfD
@SpotifyCares Great work! Really appreciate u reaching out! Will recommend Spotify to all my friends and fam! Keep up the good work!!
@SpotifyCares Nope, it doesn’t :(
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately the same problem still occurs.
@SpotifyCares What I said is pretty much what it is. I can't really accurately elaborate more on it.
@SpotifyCares Hmm, that hasn't seemed to work. And still no error message at all. Maybe this is just one of those things that'll fix itself in an update.
@SpotifyCares it says its not available in my country
@SpotifyCares i do, yes. im from the united arab emirates
@SpotifyCares Also I've been paying normal price so why are you even asking for student status, just trying to update card info but wont save
@SpotifyCares Sorry forgot to mention that I use Android 6.0.1 / Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo...
@SpotifyCares I just tried it in the web player too and it didn't work
@SpotifyCares I can't do it on my phone until tonight because I don't have time to re download my files right now
@SpotifyCares I just reinstalled on my computer and it didn't help...
@SpotifyCares Alright, I'll try that. It doesn't really make sense why it would happen on both devices though? i don't know...
@SpotifyCares devices are iPhone 7 running iOS 10.2.1 and MacBook Air 2014 running macOs Sierra 10.12.6
@SpotifyCares iOS Spotify 8.4.22
OS X Desktop Spotify 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 (is that the version #?) 
All my other music is working, just not Frank Ocean..
@SpotifyCares Thanks so much✌❤🙏
@SpotifyCares So....could i get you to Shout my music out on your page?👀❤
@SpotifyCares Pretty sure it was after updating the app but unfortunately I can’t test to know for sure.
@SpotifyCares I’ve done that and also reinstalled the app and still have the issue. Seems to be isolated to Android version. iOS not having the issue.
@SpotifyCares i was just being annoying because i wanted some twitter favs and RTs, dont worry
@SpotifyCares I was using Android 8 on a Google Pixel, with a Gen 2 Chromecast. I have Spotify set to update when connected to power and WiFi, so it was whatever was the current version on October 19th.

Sorry for this delay.
@SpotifyCares none of those apply. also, android app is up to date and doesn't let me save any artists or download any albums. premium member
@SpotifyCares OS? my device’s model is Iphone6s and version is 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares i have to download 11.0.3 but i think i have 0.2 haha. i’ll try !
@SpotifyCares it doesn’t work ):
@SpotifyCares i can play all my songs except for One Direction &amp; 5 Seconds of Summer ? download again or logout doesn’t help
@SpotifyCares I can try haha,
@SpotifyCares Hey there, that link is broken. I’ve updated my profile picture since and it hasn’t changed. Any idea why?
@SpotifyCares The self same message in the users pic above, certainly happens on all Weezer albums / tracks plus others.
@SpotifyCares UK account, some examples tomorrow now as shut the pic down already. Weezer - Butterfly is one for certain.
@SpotifyCares Here you go Weezer - Butterfly https://t.co/H67VsBd6Oa Weezer - Buddy Holy https://t.co/woldKTCcPb other bands too. Weezer plays fine 4 wife
@SpotifyCares Many times and still the same issue as per image attached. An issue lots of people are reporting it seems too!!! https://t.co/00cT1AiUfB
@SpotifyCares Okay, thanks!
@SpotifyCares I suggested it, how soon does it usually take to get an answer and the feature implemented?
@SpotifyCares Nope, it keeps happening randomly. Spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Everything I have downloaded, regardless of location gets wiped from my iPhone
@SpotifyCares I've already troubleshooted &amp; made sure I don't fall under any of these categories. I still get unexpectedly logged out - songs lost. No fix
@SpotifyCares I have just got it! ❤️
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares I have problems with Premium Family. It isnt aktive.
@SpotifyCares Nice! I made a new account and contacted CS on the site.
@SpotifyCares Just did! Thanks :)
@SpotifyCares None of those work, we seem to be going in circles here.
@SpotifyCares It's across all devices
@SpotifyCares Still not playing Arctic Monkeys
@SpotifyCares Thank you, i got it. I contacted support and they reactivated the premium and that worked!
@SpotifyCares I believe it’s the latest one out on the App Store
@SpotifyCares that worked! thanks
@SpotifyCares It only keeps my playlists, every time I download my saved music on artists they never stay downloaded 👎 done it like, 5-6 times already
@SpotifyCares Yippee!! believe so. Installation was completed today. How do I confirm?
@SpotifyCares Here you go... https://t.co/iSQ3b5FgyK
@SpotifyCares i’m not having an issue with my spotify, i was just wondering if me being in community college, am i able to get the discount
@SpotifyCares That’s done the trick, thanks!
@SpotifyCares No i press the shuffle button and it doesn't respond- every other album on my Spotify will except this one
@SpotifyCares Both but I finally got it working thank u guys ! Probably just a glitch
@SpotifyCares Mac 10.12.6, 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
Volume is about 85% that of iTunes
@SpotifyCares Negative. #FeatureEnhancement
@SpotifyCares Yes - the app has low lower volume than other applications on my machine(s)
@SpotifyCares Thanks, but not the issue. Will keep using itunes for podcasts
@SpotifyCares Your system is the issue. Not my account.
@SpotifyCares I am using it on my Windows PC updated to latest version on my widows 7 computer. No other issues, just some songs on my list are greyed out
@SpotifyCares I’m in Canada
@SpotifyCares This version https://t.co/z2tvypzknt
@SpotifyCares my school changed its name a year ago and I had premium from when I worked at Starbucks, I don’t have premium at all despite being charged
@SpotifyCares Seaswefeartosail AT gmail
@SpotifyCares That didnt help… i think i need to change something via the desktop app…I think i changed my twitter password a few weeks ago &amp; thats why
@SpotifyCares @502164 Has his music only been removed from Europe?
@SpotifyCares iOS 10.2
@SpotifyCares It doesn't happen on my MacBook but this is the Spotify I use https://t.co/llpihiXtQt
@SpotifyCares @147836 Fingers crossed ... What does that mean exactly??. Coz to me that's like "we are not sure even" or "whatever"... Actions are needed...
@SpotifyCares Cool, thanks! Just submitted this suggestion for desktop notifications https://t.co/ZXsyqEcb7H 

can I get a rt? 🤓
@SpotifyCares In my credit card. I would like that you reverse that charge. Can you do that?
@SpotifyCares I was trying to upgrade my wife's account. I filled the credit card information, but I refuse to complete the order, however I got a charge
@SpotifyCares Hi! Janella P. From Spotify solved my problem! Please thank her for me! And thank you for replying so quickly!
@SpotifyCares App told me to verify my gmail addy because they had trouble reaching me. Address is correct, have gotten prev acct email there /1
@SpotifyCares Upgrade acct to family premium, was expecting email confirmation but none, even in spam folder. /2
@SpotifyCares Invited housemates to my family acct. 2 w/ gmail never got invite. 1 w/ https://t.co/6gtn9xz0F4 got invite no problem.
@SpotifyCares I will try that. But, perf issue is not limited to this session. I guess perf is inherent to the design. Is saved music list cached locally?
@SpotifyCares Also, twitter is a ridiculous choice of support platform. I'm done here.
@SpotifyCares Love to give more details but limited to just 140 characters is pretty annoying for longer things.
@SpotifyCares Using Version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares i'm using it on my windows 7 professional PC &amp; i don't know what version it is but this is what it says: 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02.
@SpotifyCares so far, so good. i use spotify on my other devices too. it's like there's no difference in quality if you're subscribed to premium.
@SpotifyCares hey thanks! the spotify's volume control isn't as good as the itunes one. i mean, i signed up for premium yet the music quality's average.
@SpotifyCares I’m not I just click on an album and nothing happens nothing starts to play
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 and 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares Nope no difference
@SpotifyCares @37032 I’ve deleted it , I’ve turned off my phone and i log out and still doesn’t play my music
@SpotifyCares Tried it. No dice :(
@SpotifyCares Still nothing. Reinstalled and restarted the phone. No joy.
@SpotifyCares No error msg. This is all I see. When I tap on songs it just doesnt play or rgstr my tap. But I tap on songs by other artists it works fine. https://t.co/AkdLg6LKmI
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6S • iOS 11.0.3 • Spotify version 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares Also I didn’t delete nor reinstalled the spotify app on my phone
@SpotifyCares Yeah, at least my offline playlists are always there.
@SpotifyCares iOS iPhone 7+ version (8.4.22.515)
@SpotifyCares Absolutely
@SpotifyCares I listen to the ad for 30 minutes of ad free music and then 3 songs later I get another ad🤔
@SpotifyCares No thanks, I don't really want to be suggested Premium.
@SpotifyCares I tried uninstalling/reinstalling last night and the problem persisted.
@SpotifyCares I did. The "extend" link sends me to a new subscription link. Tells me about spotify + Hulu &amp; asks for card info to subscribe
@SpotifyCares The 3,333 download limit is not why I subscribed to Spotify premium.
@SpotifyCares Thank you! All fixed!
@SpotifyCares Thank you guys ❤️❤️❤️ i think my little brother changed it since it happened out of nowhere
@SpotifyCares no but i don't really care lol it's all good thanks. im watching netflix now.
@SpotifyCares Seems like that would be an important feature to have.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s, iOS 9 and version 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares It happens when I'm using it offline normally and with 3G and nope
@SpotifyCares Spotify is the only app I usually use in the background. Switching between different apps doesn't cause any problems.
@SpotifyCares It's just a recent event too, it started at the beginning of September. Ive uninstalled the app, and loggrd out and back in already.
@SpotifyCares It also crashes when I lock my phone too! I have an LG x Power 2
@SpotifyCares iPhone 5s. Spotify version 8.4.22.515.
@SpotifyCares No, still nothing!
@SpotifyCares I do like the swipe to next song though. 😉
@SpotifyCares .. Plus, this vote involve mainly on payment and transactions and not the elephant in the room which is ACCESSIBILITY of the app...
@SpotifyCares its a galaxy A3 2016 and i have android version 6.0.1, attached are my settings with spotify version https://t.co/seTJyO9b5a
@SpotifyCares Where? I don’t want to create a playlist. Just want a list of songs... https://t.co/JymNzTKBQr
@SpotifyCares Super ball ache. Is the answer no? I can’t have a list of songs in alphabetical order?
@SpotifyCares 🙄
@SpotifyCares Cheers for clarifying anyway
@SpotifyCares Great, thanks. You folks should consider adding it to the swipe feature.
@SpotifyCares Hi look at the screenshot: because classical track names are long and often have shared info at the beginning, every track name is the same!
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Here’s the album in question, although this one’s not exceptional: the problem affects most classical albums https://t.co/Gg8GBLdyQu
@SpotifyCares And has done for years, of course...
@SpotifyCares Thanks! It appears my wireless headphones are the problem as Spotify works w/ my normal earphones. They've always worked previously though?!
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I hope the feedback is seen as an opportunity, rather than criticism.
@SpotifyCares Great! Sweden // Per
@SpotifyCares Ok sorry. The question was if you plan to release "A triumph for Man" with Mew. Best regards, Per
@SpotifyCares Thank u 😇
@SpotifyCares I'm going to assume the United States. I've had the song on my playlist before. Then it just disappeared.
@SpotifyCares Desktop at work is Windows 7, Spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02. Mobile is Samsung S7 edge, so android, using 8.4.23.784 armV7.
@SpotifyCares Already done that, it didn't work :( it's really weird, it only seems to be Banks - everything else I've tried plays fine!
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/z1EnWzxWM0
@SpotifyCares just wondering why a certain song is unavailable on the catalogue, maybe due to licensing issue?
@SpotifyCares But I just wanna know, is it 192 during bluetooth streaming or will it be 320 if i set to extreme?
@SpotifyCares Yep that's better, thanks!
@SpotifyCares @368446 Nice flakey answer
@SpotifyCares Well my school isn't under the institution list
@SpotifyCares USA
@SpotifyCares adresses i dont know! I dont want to pay for a family account! I send you guys a message true the site. please resond quick! 1/2
@SpotifyCares I've voted for that, and this one too: https://t.co/SZvFqMXbOV But that suggestion is over 5yr old. What's so hard? You already label as 'E'
@SpotifyCares Best way to make it popular is to implement it. 148,000 results on Google seem to agree with me: https://t.co/Ao2QFF7cD4
@SpotifyCares At the end of the day, labelling a song is great...if you want to sit in front of your phone/tablet/PC watching the playlist.
@SpotifyCares But most people just want to hit play and let it run in the background. Particularly on Artist Radio.
@SpotifyCares I’m not in Australia tho
@SpotifyCares But I don’t like my country and it’s music
@SpotifyCares Please add Niall Horan - Flicker to spotify Germany xxx
@SpotifyCares It’s available in Australia can you like drop it
@SpotifyCares Wow a indefinite time scale, so were does this leave all the premium membership members paying  who can't use the desktop app ?
@SpotifyCares Cheers for the reply! Is there a fix planned or is it going to remain the same?
@SpotifyCares So I am currently trying on my iPhone 7 with OS 11.0.3. I have also tried listening using my MacBook Pro with OS High Sierra 10.13.
@SpotifyCares On my phone, it doesn’t say anything but on my Mac, this pops up. https://t.co/mJKb7ifKtE
@SpotifyCares It’s still giving me the same message as before.
@SpotifyCares No luck. It is still giving me the same message
@SpotifyCares Does not play on mobile either.
@SpotifyCares Hi - I've tried that(I've even provided you console logs showing the issue...). Can you please debug your side, since it's looking like something is broken in your service layer.
@SpotifyCares relevant console log : https://t.co/TbH11iSLxH
@SpotifyCares Boston, MA, USA
@SpotifyCares I have already applied it but still its not approved from past 2 weeks
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares I’m on iPhone SE, iOS 11.0.2, latest version of Spotify
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares Could you please just add the little dot under the shuffle icon like the Desktop app has? It’s perfect and should be easy to implement
@SpotifyCares Hi! Thanks for your help - Device: Surface Book, OS: Win10, Version: 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02, seems to be impacting mobile (Android 6.0) too
@SpotifyCares I think taking approve  from Spotify before going abroad also need to be a part of this rule as well. @115888 @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares I don't need to take any explanation. If you can able to explain "Why i should not be on abroad over 14 days" on public, there you go!
@SpotifyCares Just listened to Stained Silver again, error at 13 secs and  at 2:09
@SpotifyCares Right at the beginning and the second chorus, next track did it too, not sure of the rest as I turned it off
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/6hy8b31752 I'm on mobile, but does that help?
@SpotifyCares This one at 0:50 https://t.co/oc7TbVgLYm
@SpotifyCares yay, help!!! no, I don’t get any error messages. The app just doesn’t respond to clicking any Lana song. But responds + plays other songs!
@SpotifyCares It's called Bedroom Floor, though I how a feeling it's not coming out till later
@SpotifyCares I tried everything you suggested, cleared cookies and cache, using incognito browser...
@SpotifyCares Thanks.  

I am using Chrome Version 60.0.3112.113 (Official Build) (64-bit) on Mac Yosemite 10.10.5
@SpotifyCares I don't understand why you act like that...
@SpotifyCares This request exists since 2015-03-06... People stay on previous version (0.9.x) to keep the old behavior... https://t.co/haB9Qj2pYv
@SpotifyCares And it's now causing problems with playback on Google home and I can't manage the family accounts /send invitations
@SpotifyCares offline songs are getting desynced, but today every song disappeared for an hour or so, any idea why either is happening?
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.515 on iOS 11.0.3
8.4.23.784 armV7 on Android 7.0
1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 on Windows 10
The problem is the same on all devices :)
@SpotifyCares I thought all of these were the newest version? Which one do I need to update?
@SpotifyCares No error. Just doesn't play. Tried turning phone on and off. Signing in and out. Nothing...
@SpotifyCares I tried some other artists other users have been mentioning: Kendrick Lamar, Lana Del Ray don't work either.
@SpotifyCares Regardless that didn't work AND it deleted all my downloaded music. Thanks for that...
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I looked through that, but can't seem to find Seattle's office address. However, there's an internship position located in Seattle.
@SpotifyCares I knew it my english is bad, thankyou :)
@SpotifyCares it doesn't, I've tried 😣
@SpotifyCares A live representative fixed the problem. Thanks @115888 !
@SpotifyCares Yes I click Fifth Harmony He Like That song plays however this Artist Name Appears. Delete App re download but still the same
@SpotifyCares Is this a common issue you're having? It's hard to find any recent cases of specific artists being blocked to individuals.
@SpotifyCares Appreciate it, where would we be without y'all. I'll send it in a few. PS, my old non-premium account has no issues with Eminem.
@SpotifyCares 2/ Eminem does not play on MacOS and Android, but does play in the web player.
@SpotifyCares MacBook Air and also sometimes on my iPhone. Please help.
@SpotifyCares This has not helped. https://t.co/qS2b9slMvi
@SpotifyCares Still no luck guys https://t.co/LmaqVXpAVC
@SpotifyCares ah i see, you havent got the Whole tweet: Its a #Windows Phone, and i know there will not come new features to Win #Mobile #Spotify app
@SpotifyCares until now i only see it happen on 4G, and logging in Again just didnt help... it occurs suddenly and its not remakeable
@SpotifyCares i have no other Windows phone devices... it dosnt happen on my Surface 3...
@SpotifyCares and it shows its stopped at the song, not pausing or so That happens to often and i see other too have the problem in the @115888 community
@SpotifyCares That didn't but I ran an update and it looks like that might have fixed it. This has happened a few times so fingers crossed!
@SpotifyCares Yeah, the vote button doesn't work. Also last update was 1 year ago.....
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6, iOS 11.0.3, Spotify 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares That worked, cheers 👍🏻
@SpotifyCares imac 27' at work, windows 10 pc at home with the official app and in the spotify web browser all the systems are up 2 date
@SpotifyCares for example i can play disorder by joy division but i can not play anything by gorillaz o.O
@SpotifyCares i restarted the app, i logged out, but i cant re start my computer im at work, im just listening to music in youtube lol
@SpotifyCares Fyi still not working (trying this time in google chrome) https://t.co/qyCezWlHmy
@SpotifyCares Simply listening to music and moments later hear the fan fire up. CPU at 110%. Cleared all Spotify files/app, reinstalled, still happening.
@SpotifyCares HQS is turned off and all sources are disabled. Still at 110% CPU. Oof.
@SpotifyCares Settings &gt; Show Advanced Settings: no Compatibility section with the "Hardware Acceleration" option. Desktop app 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Proxy is the last section under Advanced Settings.
@SpotifyCares ahh thanks! i've been tweeting back and forth with someone from your team since last night. thank you tho
@SpotifyCares Thanks! They need to add Alexa and Google home too.
@SpotifyCares its a bit longer than 140 characters. is there an email address where I can explain?
@SpotifyCares It’s not just this one, it’s most of the albums that have been released recently https://t.co/NwRb1IyRDn
@SpotifyCares I know who the featured artists are, but why is it not on the individual tracks?
@SpotifyCares For instance the screenshot doesn’t show the featured artists on the album https://t.co/dMOSGO6csO
@SpotifyCares and this is just a single example. this happens very often
@SpotifyCares spotify 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 on OSX. when I for instance search for the artist 'eye o', it is actually result #29 in the artist search
@SpotifyCares thanks!
@SpotifyCares No error message. The player disappears when you click on a song and the app doesn’t appear to be doing anything.
@SpotifyCares Gave it a shot. Still running into the same bug.
@SpotifyCares Dang. Tried the reinstall and still can’t get my Frank.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6 Plus/iOS 11.0.3 and I’m using Spotify mobile ver. 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares Yeah i know that im saying its dumb
@SpotifyCares Same with Android, German French and English. https://t.co/Iw3wiIaZOQ
@SpotifyCares Windows 10, store app.
@SpotifyCares This one, maybe: https://t.co/nK5sJri3sQ
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s the newest iOS and newest Spotify I updated it. I'll then hit pause then play but still won't play.
@SpotifyCares Nice to hear from you. I'll be eagerly waiting for it . Thank you😊👍!!
@SpotifyCares currently i have to open the web player, start playback over there and hope the desktop app starts playback so i can find the playlist there
@SpotifyCares just give me an "open playlist from link/id" or something. thanks!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7
iOS 11.0.2
Spotify version 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares When click on the track, No Cap. Nothing happens. I don't get an error message or anything. The player doesn't pop up. Nothing
@SpotifyCares Yeah so it works on my PC but not on my iPhone. But the blue line "unable to play this song" shows on the tracks that dont work on my phone. https://t.co/N5ogB83VBn
@SpotifyCares Sad! I guess I’ll just listen to the O’Reily Auto Parts commercials then every half hour.
@SpotifyCares Hi, im running the 8.4.24.871 (latest) for android, in a sony xperia xa ultra. Basically the user interface changes, when I don't have +
@SpotifyCares Internet connect. The player is different and well I will attach picture. I even have less options for playing my music + https://t.co/bWtRwGeQPI
@SpotifyCares The player isnt the main problem. Is the part where I can't even know what songs playlist I have downloaded have (I'm a premium user) +
@SpotifyCares I have a lot of playlist, and I have them organized in folders, which disappear in the interface, plus I can't even know if the playlist +
@SpotifyCares Is downloaded or if the song are playing at random bc it doesn't give me that information. Which with Internet connect I do have+
@SpotifyCares They received positive confirmation but their accounts still aren't associated with my family plan
@SpotifyCares also doesnt let me shuffle play, tells me that its a premium feature
@SpotifyCares No that did not help.
@SpotifyCares I'm using Gaxy S6 Active and my kid has same issues with her Samsung S8. Version 8.4.23.784
@SpotifyCares So I’m currently cancelling my Spotify account and going to @115948
@SpotifyCares But I still don’t have premium and it went through as a student
@SpotifyCares Thanks for a quick response, but I just reported the charges as fraudulent to my bank. Y'all really should have a customer service phone #
@SpotifyCares Hi. I’m using iPhone 7+ with iOS11. My Spotify is 8.4.20.535. Hope you can help me with this. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares can i get free premium
@SpotifyCares As a dev, I'm not sure devs should pick features...follow the revenue ;)
@SpotifyCares All g fam, just sorted it on desktop 🤙🏼
@SpotifyCares @558120 Customer loyalty... it’s always a slap in the face to existing customers when new customers get deals that loyal customers have no access to.
@SpotifyCares why not take the whole album away then and not just the song?!
@SpotifyCares Lots of people are having same issue. And like me are premium members.
@SpotifyCares sure thing! Spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 | macOS Sierra 10.12.6. Keep up the good work! Super &lt;3 @115888
@SpotifyCares I'll attempt to capture a GIF of it the next time it occurs
@SpotifyCares Ikr
@SpotifyCares It used to work perfectly but now it randomly stop answering and even refuse to close
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8 plus.8.4.22.515 I’m not sure whether its a problem with my app or its meant to be like this but i can’t choose songs it just shakes
@SpotifyCares Deezer seems to care more about their #Windows10 customers and is improving their Windows mobile app unlike Spotify.
@SpotifyCares How do I get the URI on my phone? Only seeing this https://t.co/adSbvcIWII
@SpotifyCares The link in the message you replied to is from "copy link"
@SpotifyCares It's doing it on my PC as well.
@SpotifyCares How come Gloria Gaynor is playing though? hahaha
@SpotifyCares Logged out &gt; restarted the phone &gt; logged in again &gt; still Gloria Gaynor.
@SpotifyCares Put a link out to your subscribe page maybe? Cheers
@SpotifyCares I mean it’s cool to do podcasts, but let me just have music if that’s all I want
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7, iOS 11.0.3 and Spotify version 8.4.22 thank you :)
@SpotifyCares If I uninstall Spotify and reinstall it, will my saved playlists delete? Would I have to start new?
@SpotifyCares Well, the audio file seems broken ;) just listen to it and compare it to YouTube version. The rest seems to play fine.
@SpotifyCares It’s only this song and it’s always happening at the exact same times. The crackle is definitely in the audio file. I’m streaming premium.
@SpotifyCares I have an iPhone SE btw. And machine is windows 10. But as it’s exactly the same on both, i don’t think it’s causing the issue.
@SpotifyCares Both. Maybe you misunderstood :) it’s not the complete audio drops out.It is a “tk tk tk tk” in the background of the music which shouldn’t
@SpotifyCares I did. Thanks
@SpotifyCares shouldn't have been taken away in the first place!! thought I got that feature when I got premium?! Also make a desktop app for Chromebooks!
@SpotifyCares it's ok, thanks for understanding friend. still love Spotify over any other music service
@SpotifyCares this is not helpful i need a phone number
@SpotifyCares Oh thank you but I fixed it.
@SpotifyCares It was all moved, you click the App while in the guide and do everything there now, not optimal but thx for listening
@SpotifyCares nothing helped, so here we go again... https://t.co/NJR9Vnpm76
@SpotifyCares Great, thanks: IPhone 6+ , IOS10.3.3 , Spotify version 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares No message, just doesn't respond when pressing the solo songs. They get skipped when playing the playlist. A license thing, perhaps? https://t.co/hKaSKu8c1n
@SpotifyCares A magic Spotify-fairie made it suddenly work again! Thanks for your efforts though. Let’s listen together, cheers :) https://t.co/1ITOlBERXR
@SpotifyCares Thanks, just sent a dm
@SpotifyCares Why isn't it available tho?
@SpotifyCares the song literally has no name wtf spotify you trying to curse me
@SpotifyCares Nevermind it took awhile to recognize
@SpotifyCares It finally went through and I have premium now, have a goodnight
@SpotifyCares The other error I get says "Field Required" @hulu_support https://t.co/wRdecD0con
@SpotifyCares Looks like that whole song is gone after the re-install, will find other version. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ thanks anyway, friends! https://t.co/ajjma9MK4k
@SpotifyCares Logged out, restarted, logged in, still getting Gloria's sweet, sweet pipes.
@SpotifyCares Desktop interface keeps asking me if I want to connect with FB. I haven’t been on FB in almost a year and I want to keep it that way.
@SpotifyCares Fix your algorithm on Discover Weekly and Release Radar. It's kinda suck now.
@SpotifyCares Yeah. I have questions. Why remove it? Low engagement? So what! Was it hurting anything being there? I got to pretend I was mixing tracks
@SpotifyCares fingers crossed!!! what’s Halloween without coraline ya know? x
@SpotifyCares I tried everything. The problem goes away only for a few mins. And then it comes back.
@SpotifyCares Reinstall install. Different headphones. I tried everything. I use my headphones with other devices and they are fine. But with Iphone not.
@SpotifyCares Hey! Version 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares Disregard this message
@SpotifyCares Wow I get why there are only 82 votes, dont feel the need to join a community. Just get it done. It is there on Android so get it to iOS.
@SpotifyCares Thanks....and can u suggest me how to listen @328645 's newly released album flicker, as I can't listen on spotify...
@SpotifyCares All sorted! I guess it was delayed. Sorry for the panic and thanks for the response!
@SpotifyCares What type of payment you support then ? Beside the visa
@SpotifyCares @441311 ‘Others like you’ 😲😲😲
@SpotifyCares My identifications have been approved. However my account is now still a free one? can't figure out why. Haven't received any email either.
@SpotifyCares Nope.. besides I'm scared that if i do logging out , i cant remember the password. And my premium will run out of the time
@SpotifyCares I'm using iOS 10.2 and my Spotify version is 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares When I clicked on one of my music .. the description says it otherwise https://t.co/1FvN4YKrSe
@SpotifyCares *celebrating* https://t.co/e0B9F03c7i
@SpotifyCares Nah, we want a Discover Playlist based on multiple accounts, for maximum roadtrip fun. #singability
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your reply but this is totally bogus. The playlists feature was removed several months ago and it's just never coming back? 💁🏻
@SpotifyCares Please make it available before December 1st
@SpotifyCares Okay thanks😊🤞🏼
@SpotifyCares It's super annoying and i want it to stop. How can I change it so i don't have to keep coming back and redownloading near 100 albums?
@SpotifyCares My mother passed I haven't really had a chance to sort out my payments for Spotify
@SpotifyCares That was like 1.5 years ago though! For whatever reason, if I have an artist with 8 songs on a playlist, it will play all 8 in the next 15!
@SpotifyCares Judging off this post, the most recent edit was last year to the shuffle algorithm, and this has only been happening recently
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares I just want the student discount. It had me pay b4 verifying my enrollment &amp; wants me to pay again to activate the subscription. IDontWanna
@SpotifyCares 8.4.23.784 armV7 Android V 7.0
@SpotifyCares RC you've only gone and fixed it for me :)
@SpotifyCares I tried to find advice in the community and I couldn’t pls help me I’m so sad
@SpotifyCares pls
@SpotifyCares My account is: email: __email__. The 2nd email address is: __email__
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares they keep asking for my mobile even though I provide them with it every email &amp; when I forward the transcript they don’t reply
@SpotifyCares It's iPhone 10.3.3 (?) and it's 8.4.22.515. Thank you
@SpotifyCares Hi its a MacBook pro Sierra V. 10.12.6 and joined Spotify on 18/10/2017
@SpotifyCares Download successful but can't find download for sonos app for MacBook. can I control sonos from spotify
@SpotifyCares The album is not currently on Spotify and I desperately need it to be. cc: @5413
@SpotifyCares __email__
my family plan ends in November.
@SpotifyCares / when I 3 months ago paid you’d £119 for a yearly subscription for Spotify premium , so can you get me in touch with someone to sort this
@SpotifyCares ion wanna read your content miss me with that shit
@SpotifyCares So can anybody add to it or just people who were already following it?
@SpotifyCares It’s okay, I understand not every one can be great, but the same old songs keep popping up
@SpotifyCares The link is just a forum about an update from early 2016 and is a lot of complaints about y'all's shuffle algorithm and "the free market"
@SpotifyCares Never mind I'll just listen to Switchfoot or something
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Is there a reason why it's generated that username as I wasn't able to chose one?
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares if I log in on Chrome says I have a premium account but not on the app on my phone. How do I fix this?
@SpotifyCares appears to be some glitch in your house address verification process, different form design or something.
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares my dad and I've always paid our bills. why am I hearing ads?
@SpotifyCares this is my dad's account were talking about here. I live in the same house as him. what more do you want from us? @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Oh come on, don't give me that. I asked for it once you guys were able to provide it to me. Please do it or ask someone over there to help.
@SpotifyCares Well, Chromium~Chrome, just the opensource build of it. No banner from Spotify saying it's unsupported either. Stopped working nevertheless.
@SpotifyCares I'm using an LG G3 w/ Android OS 6.0, spotify version 8.4.24.871armV7
@SpotifyCares That, or it starts with an ad and then never gets to any songs on the playlist.
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares i don't listen to either of them. i just wanna hear the replacements
@SpotifyCares As fun as it would be to do the digital equivelant of shelf stacking I have hundreds of songs can I put in a feature request for a bulk add?
@SpotifyCares Thank you very much fingers crossed it gains some traction 🤞
@SpotifyCares Yooo, betalar månadsavgift på 99kr och vill gärna att de funkar eller att man får hjälp?!
@SpotifyCares If there’s some way to send you the debug log let me know! Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thank you! 🙂
@SpotifyCares The song is from 2009 babe if you don't have it now I doubt you will ever have it. (Cry)
@SpotifyCares Our emails are __email__ and __email__ thanks!
@SpotifyCares @43594 Here's a preview of what username she has. https://t.co/f85Xep0i9N
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8, iOS 11.0.3, Spotify v 8.4.22.515. Sometimes if I step into an artist with 2+ albums it seems to shuffle 1 at a time. Thanks guys!
@SpotifyCares it shows the whole list but i once i click on a certain song it only plays a preview?
@SpotifyCares im using a moto g play and the version i have is 8.4.23.784 armV7, im not sure about operating system haha
@SpotifyCares Redownload 1000+ songs every fortnight &amp; I don't want to use up all my data on music while I'm paying for the perk of downloads.
@SpotifyCares it was the deal at the first place? Help!
@SpotifyCares @17470 I've been kick out from premium family member and couldn't rejoin, could you check for me please?
@SpotifyCares And i also removed all offline devices except my iPhone. Still no luck. What do I do?
@SpotifyCares I just suggested it, care to retweet? :) https://t.co/m92J6SmPKO
@SpotifyCares Sorry, it's just so annoying, basic functions (lyrics, release notifications, shuffle) which worked fine in the past not working anymore,
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/iScIxiH4FV
@SpotifyCares Wow, you'd think after 2 years of complaints from your paying customers you'd have at least come up w/ an excuse. @115888 @147836
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares I don’t get it, but Usher is available here in PH. Only Separated is not available 😞
@SpotifyCares I hit retry 10 or so times and it went away, and spotify is working.
@SpotifyCares Account, so you may need to update your payment details" Then there's a button link to update my payment details?
@SpotifyCares That’s a bad solution I will not have albums saved on the one hand and on the other hand playlists. A pity you do not give that possibility.
@SpotifyCares Nope, I was just doing my homework with my music and got an ad. It was the first time it ever happened so I don’t really mind anymore. Thnx
@SpotifyCares I am 101% sure
@SpotifyCares Thank you but no I was looking for some of his remix stuff from his YouTube days. @47469
@SpotifyCares @566335 While we're at it, on mobile, why is the default green button on an album shuffle? This drives me nuts. I never want to shuffle an album
@SpotifyCares @566335 Sorry I shouldn’t hijack this. I just had feelings saved up. 😊
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/NKL3wXDNup
@SpotifyCares I deleted the app and downloaded it back #allgood! Thanks
@SpotifyCares old supscribtion
@SpotifyCares Any help lol?
@SpotifyCares left for the morning. Is there any insight as to why this happens? The app is updated to the latest version.
@SpotifyCares downloaded music forcing me to redownload everything when I get back to Wi-Fi. This extremely frustrating especially when I've already
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares then i exit the app completely, go back and try that same playlist. It doesn't work and the same thing comes up over and over.
@SpotifyCares like i made a playlist with about 4 songs, and i tried to click the songs but it wouldn't work only shuffle play would.
@SpotifyCares i'm just wondering is this just the upgrade??
@SpotifyCares I am currently living in Spain
@SpotifyCares iPhobe SE. 11.0.3. When I’m on playlists it keeps switching from the downloaded ones to the non-downloaded ones randomly on my phone
@SpotifyCares Spotify version 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares (and yes, I checked my spam)
@SpotifyCares +the reset pw website I don't get an email. But I know this is my subscription email as I was sent an email for spotify premium family
@SpotifyCares Haha, there are thousands of them. Thanks for your attention, but I thought streaming and Clouds should work in other way 😐
@SpotifyCares Good, thanks)
@SpotifyCares And when I got that feeling the 3rd time I thought that it might be a bug. Haven't you had issues with songs added to Library long time ago?
@SpotifyCares I realize that their tracks are not in my Library, but I used to like them and totally should mark them as my favorite.
@SpotifyCares Hi :) I have that feeling because when I open different old artists that I used to listen a year or smth ago…
@SpotifyCares Windows 7 on PC.  Using Chrome.
@SpotifyCares I'm using an individual internet, only I have access. Could you tell me where I see the spotify version?
@SpotifyCares For 14 days whilst overseas* that is...
@SpotifyCares @ is an adress mail
@SpotifyCares And I get an error404 ifI try to connect via facebook. Could you help me please?
@SpotifyCares chris brown ruins every new music friday!
@SpotifyCares I’ve never listened to music that is similar so I’m wondering why it started popping up all of a sudden.
@SpotifyCares How y’all gon let me pay 10 a month and delete my fav song https://t.co/R97xuY7Ekn
@SpotifyCares @147836 This button doesn't work ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ https://t.co/sRiOnqk7c6
@SpotifyCares @147836 Web app.
@SpotifyCares I see I can manually retrieve them all from my settings in browser, but I did not delete any of them. really strange. This a known bug ?
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares and these two https://t.co/4Xf1agCONv
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares same with these two albums https://t.co/cyvXltsghH
@SpotifyCares Better, thanks!
@SpotifyCares This is quickly becoming the worst customer service experience I’ve ever had.  How long does it take to get a response and talk to someone?
@SpotifyCares This has been a horrific customer service experience. You don’t have a phone number to talk to someone but respond at your leisure??? #Awful
@SpotifyCares Yes did that seems it’s a very mysterious process and u can’t recommend talent in. All seems a bit of a closed offer which isn’t a great look 👀
@SpotifyCares thanks lads
@SpotifyCares #insanity
@SpotifyCares And you aren’t concerned that @53983 mixed up the personal information of two of your customers, sharing it with each other?
@SpotifyCares this is on my laptop, not mobile but thanks
@SpotifyCares honestly no idea. Should be the most up to date as i have only got it on my laptop a few days ago
@SpotifyCares Thanks, but I've seen this before.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app before, and this continues to happen. It's aggravating.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response. I deleted the app and downloaded it again. Works fine now.
@SpotifyCares ... and that you guys haven't solved it at all, so I guess I should start looking for another service, not that you care of course (2/2)
@SpotifyCares Restarting worked!! Thank you 🙏🏼
@SpotifyCares Appreciate it
@SpotifyCares thank you :) x
@SpotifyCares well while u're there I'm having trouble with my WiFi and also some of the oven hob rings don't fully light and I feel kinda listless.
@SpotifyCares If this doesn’t get rectified I’m cancelling and going to Apple Music as it is cheaper after all!! #unhappycustomer
@SpotifyCares I can’t, I lost access to my Facebook for good. Any other way to help me? Can I dissociate the account or transfer it to other mail or something?
@SpotifyCares Thanks, next week will be better, can't imagine it can be worse ;)
@SpotifyCares The update resolved the issue by changing heart icon to plus icon thanks 😄
@SpotifyCares The latest one on the app store, version 8.4.24.506
@SpotifyCares and GOT7
@SpotifyCares yes it is!!! omg, thank you!!
@SpotifyCares thank you! 🔥
@SpotifyCares can you do this on iphone?
@SpotifyCares I do https://t.co/1fdPJlWprN
@SpotifyCares Mac OS El Capitan 10.11.6 / Macbook Pro Retina / Spotify 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 / Already tried uninstalling and removal of caches folders.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/043Dtn071v
@SpotifyCares Tried on my Android. Not working. Tried on a coworker computer with my account, not working also. Working with his account :)
@SpotifyCares i don't want to install it or re-install it, never did install it it installed itself, acts like mal/spyware hidden in files and so i can't locate it to un-install
@SpotifyCares my spotify is set to the US!
@SpotifyCares please allow us to listen to Hello by Seventeen 😢
@SpotifyCares Oh okay thank you! I really hope that it comes back on because it’s one of my favourite like a versions!!!
@SpotifyCares That was fast! Im using windows 7 professional. It is an hp desktop. Web player
@SpotifyCares Better! Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Nothing to do w/ my device or version. You have pieces on my artist page (which I can't control!) that aren't for the public. How'd you get?
@SpotifyCares Thanks, but I'm pretty sure I've tried that...
@SpotifyCares Sent via dm
@SpotifyCares Yes. Viewing and listening to it
@SpotifyCares Any idea when you guys can get his mixtapes?
@SpotifyCares How soon? 🙃
@SpotifyCares it happened few times already and it’s hard to download so many albums again and again
@SpotifyCares That worked. Thanks
@SpotifyCares I'm a paying customer. Not sure what I'm paying for. This keeps happening both on moblile and laptop. #fedup
@SpotifyCares So much for Spotifycares more like Spotify promotes  listening to swearing and adult content . Off to Amazon or Apple they have controls
@SpotifyCares I sent a dm with full explanation
@SpotifyCares Make sense? I’m on iOS. Cheers (2/2)
@SpotifyCares Thank you! I’ll get to work on this now.
@SpotifyCares Recommend what exactly? It’s it’s been escalated and I’ve given them a solution and they ignore me. I WANT MY MONEY!
@SpotifyCares I gave them the info they needed over a week ago. I even gave them an alternative solution. Tired of the BS! I NEED MY $80
@SpotifyCares Yeah they got back to me and said I would have to wait another 14 days to get my refund! THIS COMPANY SUCKS!!
@SpotifyCares Desktop, but I restarted the app and it was fixed. Initially was hoping it was a fun prank like rickrolling but more confusing.
@SpotifyCares I registered via facebook __email__
@SpotifyCares How do these votes affect the product roadmap? Not sure what else 1000+ devs could be working on.
@SpotifyCares Well, this doesn't help me at all. I haven't updated the app and I'm in the middle of the amazon rainforest on a slow 4G connection
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately, it is. I’m using an iPhone 7 on the latest (horrible) iOS.
@SpotifyCares That did fix the issue, thanks for the help! ❤️
@SpotifyCares Thats ok we worked it out, their last name had a ' in it on facebook so needed that.  Thanks andrew
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply. I am using VAIO E series, Windows 10, And #Spotify 1.0.66.478.g1296534d. Let me know about it.
@SpotifyCares Well, looks like it works properly for few pages and for many pages it doesn't. Thanks anyway.
@SpotifyCares I dont know about other device. I need to check. In web app it works right. I opened web app after really long time &amp; I am shocked. Its BAD.
@SpotifyCares That thing I don't know. No idea.
@SpotifyCares Android 7 (Nougat), Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, Spotify version 8.4.24.871armV7. And I did a search on Google which backs it up.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/AWzUMRXGRK
@SpotifyCares Thanks, even if it's just a 'Volume Boost' option in the app. I'd be happy with.
@SpotifyCares It doesn't help. Sort yourselves out
@SpotifyCares iOS phone, web and Android tablet
@SpotifyCares Its workin now nvm thanks love u
@SpotifyCares Hey guys. Thanks for this. Some reason it works now. You must have scared in to action. 😁

@SpotifyCares Thank you so much! I truly appreciate it.
@SpotifyCares @115940 Work together. Figure it out so it isn’t costing me to supposedly get this discount smh

@SpotifyCares Thanks for reaching out ! I would be really excited to have spotify finally in India ! Please make real efforts to make it !
@SpotifyCares Lol I'm aware 🙈
@SpotifyCares The error I'm getting is that I need to be online to login but I'm connected to my 4G.
@SpotifyCares I went to the browser version and removed my phone from the offline devices list but still can't access my account in-app
@SpotifyCares I rely on phone as my music player. Only download over WiFi. So if my downloads disappear I can be without music for days if traveling 2/2
@SpotifyCares No, playlists not affected
@SpotifyCares Galaxy A3 2016, android 6.0.1. Spotify version attached https://t.co/C7wdywLepk
@SpotifyCares 2/2 disappeared while I was at home or out and about but not listening
@SpotifyCares it happened again and i feel like i paid attention to all the steps
@SpotifyCares i don't think so. i'm using a google pixel; idk if there have been any weird overarching issues there
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/cL4mANIu5Q and UK
@SpotifyCares This ad. I guess it's a band. Oh well. #culture? https://t.co/NC7JQoHkRq
@SpotifyCares okay.. but like.. when :-/
@SpotifyCares None of those apply. It's certainly a bug. The app kicked me to the login screen and login doesn't work offline, you have to "go online".
@SpotifyCares and there's no way to go back online from the login screen. So I had to wipe the app. Now I'm on a plane without my music, which sucks.
@SpotifyCares Yeah, everything else shows up in my weekly, except for rap, no matter how much I save / add / etc.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/nc69ah1yRO
@SpotifyCares I’ve sorted it now and cancelled but I want a refund because I haven’t used the account for about a year!
@SpotifyCares I need Spotify for my assignment which is due Wednessday.
@SpotifyCares people have been asking for this for over 5 years https://t.co/CvZo88bqob and it was updated 2 years ago with a 'not right now' so, back to @115948!
@SpotifyCares Yes. My other tweet about a local album.
@SpotifyCares But it’s an album I have locally. Why would you have this “feature” if it’s practically useless?
@SpotifyCares Do you realizehow ridiculous that is? How useless this part of your service is? What is the point of showing local files if I can’t listen to an album?
@SpotifyCares That’s not the same. So I have to open iTunes, refer to the album, chase down 27 individual tracks in Spotify, put them into a playlist, and fix their order? How about you do that mess and let me know how it goes.
@SpotifyCares it appeared I had to update and restart. All clear here. Thanks
@SpotifyCares The Spotify community feels that this is a top priority.  How long would it take to have this implemented?
@SpotifyCares I have a Windows 10 machine with multiple users, all with their own Spotify accounts. Using the standard installer only gives me the app.
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much!
@SpotifyCares the recent update of spotify for a laptop and on a @121548 laptop
@SpotifyCares good idea, pretend like you care about ur problems then try to suck money from me :)
@SpotifyCares it's was little weird, soon as I logged in it downloaded a file? But it's working again now!
@SpotifyCares Use my Spotify premium.
@SpotifyCares Why yes of course. I switched to the student cost about five days ago. I paid for it and I see a charge on the account but I’m not able to u
@SpotifyCares That doesn't really help when the songs over and you can't go back. I would prefer a lyrics only option that people could switch between.
@SpotifyCares Awesome, thanks! Hope they think about it :3 x
@SpotifyCares Haha it's just that I was very passionate about Evan and Jaron when I was 13, and I was NOT 13 in the 90s haha. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares So will it still be free?
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+ with iOS 11.0.3, I’m using Spotify premium on my phone, it doesn’t need an update or anything https://t.co/2GkNstupY0
@SpotifyCares I undownloaded some of the songs I had downloaded, but it’s still giving me this message
@SpotifyCares Nope, it let me listen to like two songs and then stopped. Every time I close the app and retry it just plays me an ad and then nothing
@SpotifyCares They stop and then when I press shuffle again this comes up https://t.co/kFgvOfD6rc
@SpotifyCares I don't have another card in the mean time but don't want to cancel my acc? Is there anything I can do to avoid this?
@SpotifyCares It’s usually okay, but now every 5 minutes or so random music blares out (on full volume) - for headphone users like me, it’s horrible.
@SpotifyCares Just tried it and after 10/15 minutes of listening, it begins again. It’s impossible to listen to music when they keep playing over it.
@SpotifyCares Reinstalled and 2 minutes through my second song an advert for Maltesers starts playing - unable to cross these types of adverts off too.
@SpotifyCares They also always appear right after this picture of a car appears. Or at least I think they do.
@SpotifyCares Yeah I found a lot of threads about this idea, dating back to 2015. Even one with 1500+ votes. Seems like these ideas aren't listened to.
@SpotifyCares USA...thank you!
@SpotifyCares Awesome! I'm using a Mac Book pro, and have Spotify downloaded
@SpotifyCares The sound was coming from the banner ads, which is why I was confused. I'm not sure which version I have now, how would I check?
@SpotifyCares Ya it’s like “whoops your credit card company is having a bad day”
@SpotifyCares I know you guys have list but none of the stores have them 😒 can y'all keep my premium on until Friday.  I've been using @115888 for years
@SpotifyCares oh hi spotify how are you today i didn’t expect you on my profile
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the info!
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your prompt response. It plays 1 or 2 tracks then freezes or not play at all. It’s not doing that with his other albums
@SpotifyCares I phone 7 plus https://t.co/OVdg8fyA1A
@SpotifyCares USA
@SpotifyCares I uninstalled and reinstalled. Works fine now. Thank you. I have to listen to @575404 all day everyday.
@SpotifyCares Didn't work, I'm afraid. Words can't describe how annoying this is.
@SpotifyCares iOS app version 8.4.24.506. But you don't you create a pure Spotify music player without all the annoying add-ons? I just want my music.
@SpotifyCares all the time and have to reset Username/Password but sometimes still doesn’t work and by then I’ve lost scrobbles already
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.3/Spotify V:8.4.24.506 - just did it again on my drive to work :(
@SpotifyCares Nope - even logged out and back in and won't scrobble from my phone. :(
@SpotifyCares Hi! I think the version is 1.0.66.478.g1296534d. This song is not available, if you have the file on your computer you can import it.
@SpotifyCares I've tried it on my Iphone 7 and have no problems. I tried 10 different songs and had no problem with any of them.
@SpotifyCares And after that the instruction said the code isn't valid &amp;after she already invited with her 2nd email it same notification like the 1st (2)
@SpotifyCares It was just a feature you had a while ago. I'm using an android device but would love to find a way to see lyrics while I'm listening
@SpotifyCares Gigabytes of data that Spotify app now says is not offline content. No updates, use it daily and always pay my bill. No storage errors https://t.co/mOmpC9zXQW
@SpotifyCares Both. I had about 10gb of music for offline use..turned on spotify, it stated no offline content
@SpotifyCares Just solved it via online chat. Thanks
@SpotifyCares i’m listening on spotify web player on chrome.
@SpotifyCares why can not I make a spotify payment with cash
@SpotifyCares Holy shit I didn't know Spotify actually cares! I'll dm
@SpotifyCares Oops, seems your card or payment provider is having a bad day. Don't worry, no money has been charged. Try again or use another payment meth
@SpotifyCares Been like this for at least 36 hours now.
@SpotifyCares It's probably related to the fact that I had another old 🇫🇷 account connected to that FB account, so it's not using my new 🇧🇪 account 😕
@SpotifyCares Five years and counting... Make it happen! 😊
@SpotifyCares Did several times, no luck.
@SpotifyCares Nope, all is updated to latest available versions/firmware.
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much for delivering a fast and exceptional service! A big help. Now I can enjoy my spotify premium with no worries. Kudos 🍻☺
@SpotifyCares I’m using a iPhone 6s, iOS 11.0.3 and version 8.4.24. Did more investigating and it seems to only be the “Freah Electronic” playlist.
@SpotifyCares On the MacBook Pro late 2012 and iPhone 5c. I am using the latest version on the devices.
@SpotifyCares It doesn't work
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/aUa1RZRqxR
@SpotifyCares I see, thanks! And there is nothing for the desktop version?
@SpotifyCares Haha was waiting for that. “Pay us money and well stop smashing your ears with our overly loud adds” 😂😂🤘 smooth
@SpotifyCares Im winding you up mr Spotify, relax. 😇 
I like shuffle it makes me listen to new music 🙂🤘 il rejoin when im ready dont worry 🤘
@SpotifyCares Its just 1 the adds thats louder than the others. My ears are better than yours they are tremendous, people say iv the best ears believe me
@SpotifyCares Nexus 5, android 6.0.1, Spotify: 8.4.17.640 armV7
@SpotifyCares But it worked on older versions, but I'll take a look at it.
@SpotifyCares Everything seems to be working fine.
@SpotifyCares I'm using this on the LG G6 running Android 7.0 and like I said, I haven't gotten Spotify yet because I wanted to know if it works on the Google Home
@SpotifyCares Still the same. Shows Free sub only ??
@SpotifyCares Still the same. On the web browser account it says he is prt of the group, but the app still says Free sub ???
@SpotifyCares And my account is only logged in on 1 device.
@SpotifyCares Your tech support helped me to sign up with a username. You should know that “Ivan S” at your support is the BEST there is. 10/10 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
@SpotifyCares It's not a specific advert, every advert that shows on the ad breaks. I know that the adverts are being played from the box in red though https://t.co/B50SUITuft
@SpotifyCares I have done now, worked for a bit, but adverts started playing over songs again
@SpotifyCares I'm using the latest version on Desktop 😅
@SpotifyCares Windows 10 and Spotify for Android.
@SpotifyCares Yes they are. But, it takes couple of minutes to open a song or search a song properly at the first starts(when you open the app first time)
@SpotifyCares Yes actually. Just admit it that you have problem at the first starts man! Haha!
@SpotifyCares It's all ok, and sorted itself out now! Thank you anyway :)
@SpotifyCares Hi, I've reinstalled the app now so it is - Spotify version 8.4.24.506 and I'm on ios 10 still.
@SpotifyCares Yeah I had to buy premium through the Unidays website it didn't work through the Spotify app
@SpotifyCares It was my Release Radar which almost makes it worse... bc I definitely don't listen to Christian pop gospel 👀
@SpotifyCares I haven’t paid my package yet as I’m unsure if I want to, it’s always happening
@SpotifyCares Not too sure how Steps fits in amongst C.20 Romantic/postwar classical music could you advise
@SpotifyCares I mean, the free 30 day trial
@SpotifyCares I’ve been listening to the music I like for years and it gets even worst... 😑
@SpotifyCares … I could star 4-5 tracks from the list. Now it’s rarely more than max 1. And often zero
@SpotifyCares i've been using spotify since 2010 and have a few thousand tracks in my playlist, I'm a power user :p
@SpotifyCares I found it ... for some reason our albums got posted to Peregrines... Not the peregrines. So Peregrines are taking our streams. Please fix
@SpotifyCares It has the same email address as my personal music Benjamin Longmire. Please help. Why doesn't the peregrines have it's own page on spotify
@SpotifyCares my phone's a samsung j2 prime btw so yea, android. my previous phone was a lenovo
@SpotifyCares Nah. Make Spotify Student work with NUS cards again and we'll talk.
@SpotifyCares Oh, so you would get them only if you had saved searches, playlists, etc. for Foo Fighters on Spotify?
@SpotifyCares i just found out i got hacked. my account was on my e-mail but now it is on __email__
i can still login to the account with my 1/
@SpotifyCares facebook login. but i cant change the e-mail or the password..
what can i do?  please help
@SpotifyCares my username is thabend0r
@SpotifyCares Yeah, I already deleted cookies and browsing history, but it keeps automatically refreshing and showing the three dots
@SpotifyCares All fixed up now, thanks to your great support on live chat. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares This is not an “artist support” issue. This is a legal issue and @115888 and @14035 really need to get it straightened out, ASAP.
@SpotifyCares @115888 @14035 If I were the true rights holder to one of those songs, I’d be pretty upset to know that someone else was receiving NOIs.
@SpotifyCares and btw, we fill in the same address. :( please help.
@SpotifyCares Google Chrome on OSX. Doesn't play out there are some javascript errors in console.
@SpotifyCares @ UK. Signup works now out of blue. But still don't get why is playlist embed code making 127.0.0.1 calls. https://t.co/H3oUXr7dsW
@SpotifyCares ...I'm just one guy with an iPhone 4 but if you go look at your stats of users who installed on iPhone 4, how many of them had paying subscriptions which ended once they learned the app no longer works? Its bad practice imo, you should never be too big too care about customers.
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares Yeah, that’d be awesome, thanks! And I never knew that spotify.me thing until now! I had a good laugh looking at it, thank you 😂
@SpotifyCares Appreciate the response-- Better feedback from me: have an option like with the radio playlists where you can up/down vote something. Thx!
@SpotifyCares it says case closed :/
@SpotifyCares I also just wanted to let you know that today they posted that they wouldn't offer this. Should I still vote for it?
@SpotifyCares Okays, well its an Intel i7 Desktop running Fall Creators edi Windows 10 64bit. Spotify version is 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares thanks! :)
@SpotifyCares Well it must be possible bc its happening  !!
@SpotifyCares Wt ever. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Do I have to wait until the first day if school to sign up or when can I?
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the fast response, much appreciated 😊❤️
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response, though. Now I gotta to back to trimming my library
@SpotifyCares This wouldn't be so bad if I could cast from the mobile app yo the Roku. It's pretty janky to use a Chromecast on a Roku tv.
@SpotifyCares How do I fix this?? It was okay before I updated iOS https://t.co/FtitMIQEfD
@SpotifyCares  help
@SpotifyCares I would just like to shuffle play Vince Staples, not trying to listen to the "This Is: Vince Staples" playlist https://t.co/69Qc3haoOr
@SpotifyCares first off, this is annoying because I am just trying to listen to his body of work, not every song he's ever been featured in
@SpotifyCares secondly, this is annoying because it does not do this with less popular artists https://t.co/kaAEHGYbIv
@SpotifyCares not cool to force people to listen to spotify created playlists, especially not subscribers. why are options being taken away?
@SpotifyCares Yes, this happens when I click shuffle play. It only happens on my phone (which is updated to the current version), not on my PC or Surface.
@SpotifyCares This Req is over 5yrs old w/ many responses. It is past time for implementation. Hire me - I will implement this feature.
@SpotifyCares Chrome browser,  windows 7. It's the web-based player
@SpotifyCares There were a number of apps &amp; tabs open. Occurred during "assassination of Jesse James by coward Robert Ford" sountrack.
@SpotifyCares I'll let you know.
@SpotifyCares 8.4.24.506
@SpotifyCares Looks like I can only replicate it with this playlist
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/LXdqYzZXTy
@SpotifyCares Thank you. Is there an article about putting local files on my phone to play if that is possible?
@SpotifyCares My password isn’t working and I️ have tried both emails. Trying to reset it.
@SpotifyCares U guys fixed it once but its back
@SpotifyCares Cdbaby is my distributor i have a artist page on spotify already w/ blue check
@SpotifyCares But you guys fixed it once already
@SpotifyCares Fifth time this year. Paying customers shouldn't be constantly worried that their dl'ed music is just gonna disappear without any warning.
@SpotifyCares PC: Windows 10, Spotify v10.66.478.g1296534d. Phone: Android 7.1.1, Spotify v8.4.25.771.armV7
@SpotifyCares OK. If I do that, will I lose the music I've downloaded?
@SpotifyCares I went ahead and tried. That didn't fix it. I'm still getting the notifications.
@SpotifyCares I had to reboot my modem after the restart. Seems to be working now. But I'm hesitant to use the app if it means I'm going to lose work.
@SpotifyCares Hey guess what? It just froze my system AGAIN. Uninstalled. This has been an ongoing problem for many users for MONTHS. #FixThis
@SpotifyCares Windows 10 and whatever the last version released was. I can't tell what that was because I've removed the app until this is fixed.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response. Did that yesterday. It worked exactly once. Locked my system up again today.
@SpotifyCares I asked them. They said to contact you
@SpotifyCares Again. They said to contact you.
@SpotifyCares Now its __email__ i want to update it to __email__
@SpotifyCares that's to a device at the moment. Does that make a difference?
@SpotifyCares Problem is I might like starting my evening with the same song, but I don't want to hear the same 30 every single time... It's a nightmare!!
@SpotifyCares It's the same when sorting by Artist/Song/Album/Date Added/Length - it just grabs the songs around it and muddles them up a bit!
@SpotifyCares Hi, thanks but it still doesn't do anything right! Eg: I pressed play on a song in All Songs with shuffle on, and THIS was the queue it made https://t.co/kNijQ0Pp0a
@SpotifyCares Just did it! Thanks for being so fast!
@SpotifyCares I deleted the app and reinstalled the first time.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/XWgIBYZOAj
@SpotifyCares Hi. No it didn’t crash. It happens every time I get 30 minutes ad free music. After a couple of minutes a commercial starts.
@SpotifyCares Euuuh, I wish I can.. I appreciate if you can provide me with a phone number or email address.
@SpotifyCares Thanks.... I love you... No hommo ✌
@SpotifyCares I’m on iOS 11.0.3 on the iPhone 7 Plus. I’m also on version 8.4.25 of your app. I’ve logged in and out &amp; restarted my phone. No luck.
@SpotifyCares I’ve already tried this, and still nothing.
@SpotifyCares I tried it again and (after about 6 attempts over today and lastnight) it FINALLY went through. XD thanks for replying so fast!!
@SpotifyCares I know it’s not possible. Seems this idea was shared on the community page in a letter dated in 2015. Glad to know this company acts fast. 🙄
@SpotifyCares Worry? It’s a simple decision to switch to Apple Music or Google Play who had the foresight to include this BASIC feature. #hopeisforsuckers
@SpotifyCares No, weirdly enough
@SpotifyCares Thx for quick reply! Checking now.
@SpotifyCares I've looked into that page already; the songs were just in the main library section, so no good. Can I view the play history of my account?
@SpotifyCares I found a further link via "Queue" is it true that I can only see the last 50 played? That would be a huge bummer to loose so much.
@SpotifyCares I mean it’s working now after I had to wait a good 20 min but this is an occurrence that happens on my eyefone 7 so fix it por favor ♥️
@SpotifyCares Yeah I’ve done that a few times now and updated the app, the songs show and play on PC, but don’t show at all on phone
@SpotifyCares Yeah for sure, however it may be problems with my uni WiFi? Possibly give it a try on a different, non eduroam connection
@SpotifyCares How about in the middle east? I have signd already.
@SpotifyCares Omg! I hope so! I hope it will be tomorrow.☺
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares And will sending it out to the community get the software developers' attention?
@SpotifyCares I stumbled upon this album https://t.co/DbWjPU0AEt and the name of the other artist isn't mentioned (thus not searchable).
@SpotifyCares Im currently using spotify premium. And ive try so many time to log in my pc. But they always mentioning error code 7 error code 2
@SpotifyCares Ive been logging out n restart my device n the problems remain unchanged. My Spotify version is the premium one. Now it shows error code 4
@SpotifyCares I have ideas but they are not free
@SpotifyCares And Oblivion was actually playing btw
@SpotifyCares Samsung Galaxy S4.
@SpotifyCares When you click on it, it is the right song and cover again**
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6, iOS 11.somethingorother, the latest version in the app story. It’s all sorted now. Uninstalled and ya know reinstalled.
@SpotifyCares Did I miss a communication about this? Or am I wrong?
@SpotifyCares Previously it was not working, only if all devices use the same wifi. Now it works if connected to the same network. This is great
@SpotifyCares Oh, I thought someone was just overly excited to start Xmas music season and was joking, not that it was an actual glitch. Here, anyway https://t.co/QOsIg007un
@SpotifyCares That was my trackkkkk 😩🙄
@SpotifyCares And then could you straighten it?
@SpotifyCares Can you let me know straight away when someone is straightening it? Like, I want to be the first to know. Don’t tell @228893, tell me.
@SpotifyCares Hi. My Spotify is in french but all ads are in Dutch. I don’t know why :-/
@SpotifyCares Oh I see. That's why. Thank you! It should be indicated in https://t.co/0mJ7kHeljC tho not in ur customer service site to avoid confusion.
@SpotifyCares Done 👍🏻
@SpotifyCares This doesn't help, no
@SpotifyCares I do get lock screen controls
@SpotifyCares hi, I already subscribe for the premium, and download via mobile network is on. But I still can't download the song. :(
@SpotifyCares Sent.
@SpotifyCares all of them :-((((( i am dying with my loud co-workers. thank you so much for your attention! &lt;3
@SpotifyCares Hello guys, thanks for the response. I cleared everything, and reinstalled. Looks good now. I'm on Windows 10 with ver 1.0.65.320 (truncated)
@SpotifyCares Anything??? x
@SpotifyCares So why are only two tracks available to stream? Seems an odd way to do things: in practical terms if it can’t be played, it is not released.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for explaining. Just find it odd you list release date when it will be unavailable. Think most would assume it means you’ll have it.
@SpotifyCares Awesome, cheers guys. :) https://t.co/4cF8fk5V70
@SpotifyCares Which looks really unprofessional.
@SpotifyCares Doesn't help at all really.
I want to create a playlist from "artistX" but can only do it from their personal profile, not artist page
@SpotifyCares Version 8.4.24.506. Logged out and restarted. Seems to be working now. Will keep you updated
@SpotifyCares @117153 still having an issue and not able to access premium account. There no Spotify customer service email or no way reach out.
@SpotifyCares @118134 Great, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Oh my god did you just send a song ... that is not available in my Spotify app. I'm sad.
@SpotifyCares I understand!! sorry- didn't mean to say it as if you were discriminating! politics &amp;words are powerful ! thank you for clarifying though :)
@SpotifyCares Yes. Bcs I've downloaded all the songs before.
@SpotifyCares There are no error messages.  After the update, the Spotify App doesn't show up for the BMW Connected Drive.
@SpotifyCares @304409 Connected drive screen. iOS is 11.1
@SpotifyCares Your banner ads have started playing at the same time as songs -looping
@SpotifyCares The ad was playing snapshots of different songs from different artists like a 'now 58' kind of thing
@SpotifyCares I don't have the ad any more I had to close Spotify to stop it
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/TY7JxRMNYE
@SpotifyCares Blank screen after searching for something, music failing to play for a few min when launching, fails to load album/artist page. I usually
@SpotifyCares solve this w a restart/fresh install, but it keeps happening every so often. It's now working, but earlier today had to give up. v1.0.66.478
@SpotifyCares thats great and all, but its 2017. you shouldn't need your users votes to know this is something that you should already have implemented...
@SpotifyCares I don't even like Apple Music but your lack of support has me seriously thinking about switching
@SpotifyCares Also, some guy created an app but you shut him down, hired him, and killed his product.... #spotty https://t.co/O25FNhDlD3
@SpotifyCares The Apple Watch series 3 with cellular.  Thats enough reason alone.
@SpotifyCares For one payment
@SpotifyCares Voted! https://t.co/Idsn569mrY
@SpotifyCares Neither the com.spotify.Client or Spotify folders were present on my system. Deleted the app, downloaded and installed. "Songs" still empty.
@SpotifyCares All my songs are still saved. Albums and artists are populated with my library. "Songs" tab returns this: https://t.co/5EiyAvS8tb
@SpotifyCares Playlists are fine too.
@SpotifyCares macOS Sierra: 10.12.6
Spotify: 1.0.66.478.g1296534d
@SpotifyCares Its all good, what ever was broken is now fixed.
@SpotifyCares Will Spotify be changing this anytime soon? I'd love to stay with Spotify but I can't keep removing music I like just to add more
@SpotifyCares it legit only happens when I listen to 21 savage's issa album. sometimes the album refuses to play. This is on mobile btw.
@SpotifyCares No error messages. I'm on an android and I believe my spotify is at the newest version.
@SpotifyCares I have an  s7 edge and my version is 7.0

No, I use spotify on my computer as well and it doesn't happen on there.
@SpotifyCares I restarted my phone back when it refused to play. It fixed it afterwards, but the problem still comes up from time to time.
@SpotifyCares 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
@SpotifyCares Resurrect that preview feature...
@SpotifyCares iphone 7 ios 11 or something. Whenever I try to skip songs my music just stops working. AND AFTER EVERY AD TOO.
@SpotifyCares &gt;&gt; of how it appeared in the app https://t.co/Xfo0dWqooN
@SpotifyCares You have everything else they’ve done tho this is unacceptable
@SpotifyCares Ok then
@SpotifyCares Put it on there or else I’ll cancel my premium subscription with the app. You have everything on there by them except that ep.
@SpotifyCares It's ok, I still 💓 you. Just seems to have been a consistent issue since launch, across both iOS &amp; Android. I'm rocking a Pixel currently.
@SpotifyCares It’s on every device. It says “Epic collection” and my library is full so I can’t add more songs without deleting them.
@SpotifyCares Awesome. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Ah thank you. Thought it would be in the dots next to each song like on the desktop version.
@SpotifyCares iPhone SE - OS 10.3.3 - Spotify 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares Been reaching out since March to nada. Any way to expedite?
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/DPl3f34VgI
@SpotifyCares The device is a Marantz M-CR610. It does not have an operating system or a app version. https://t.co/y4ESt1jIps
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Also I’m in the US so most likely US
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7plus iOS 11.1.1 and not sure on app version
@SpotifyCares Blancmange haven't got it listed on their site amd neither have Heaven 17, but thanks for claifying :-)
@SpotifyCares But I am a university student and enrolled and its on the list of approved ones
@SpotifyCares Android 8.0 Nexus 6P - Spotify version 8.4.26.770 armv7
Windows 10 Pro v1607 build 14393.1066 - Spotify version 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3 (not sure if that's right, couldn't find it specified in desktop app). Issue occurs on both devices.
@SpotifyCares Apps on both devices are restarted in between each use (2-3x/day minimum), Android app has had cache cleared and been reinstalled at least once since this issue began. Streaming vs downloaded makes no difference, also.
@SpotifyCares Also discovered the song (https://t.co/JJVF0IXR2L) will begin at 1:12 or 1:13 when pressing the back button on the song, forward, or just letting it play next in queue, but not when pressing play on the song (if that helps any).
@SpotifyCares How long does it take every other app I use have updated
@SpotifyCares Nope, thank you. :) Do I have any chance in the available vacancies ? :))
@SpotifyCares I've been using Premium over a year. You need more data of mine? As a software engineer, dealing with Machine Learning, better to keep some categories such as anthems, team songs keeping them away in the list of discovery section. I don't think everybody will be as nice as now.
@SpotifyCares When then, you are making wrong decisions about my taste, why would I want to listen to another song of  soccer team which I don't support?
@SpotifyCares Thanks, great stats over there! Couldn't find what I was looking for, though, but no problem at all.
@SpotifyCares Thank you for getting back to me. I am 100% serious about wanting to help as I know my dad's influences and tastes better than most
@SpotifyCares So? How’s it going?
It’s been several hours since my Premium is activated and it still says “Free” on iOS and Mac app
@SpotifyCares Thankyou! It's back to normal now! And I have the free version
@SpotifyCares No, mob app is fine. It wasn't any particular song, it was seemingly all songs. So here's a random URI spotify:track:18ZK9RiSZdZVTkzVFw0yin
@SpotifyCares I have been trying to enter my new card details in the update payment details box for two days and it says the card doesn't work
@SpotifyCares I have used it for various other online transactions
@SpotifyCares That update appears to be from last year. This is happening today.
@SpotifyCares Here’s the right artist page:  https://t.co/I95jYaJEQI 

Here’s the EP that’s not appearing on my artist page:

@SpotifyCares Sweden
@SpotifyCares but my public playlist and video music playlist is gone, F u hacker!!!!
@SpotifyCares Thank you https://t.co/R9xLJzQSkr
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I've given my vote. Any idea how many it needs to be implemented?
@SpotifyCares I am using at IOS. The usual situation For example. 2 songs in row from same album, same artists, I have enough songs to shuffle. https://t.co/g56i9WXiai
@SpotifyCares Generally I am using a headphone or earpods. And i am not using any playlist. I use whole song list
@SpotifyCares also, it is bizarre that I couldn't find your cust service phone number or email. and the only address that emails me is no reply :(
@SpotifyCares I didn't ask about the desktop app, I asked about the web app.
@SpotifyCares wow, the power of the internet. thank you, i appreciate that.
@SpotifyCares Thanks I got super worked up about it 😅
@SpotifyCares Saved songs/albums.

The hasty response is much appreciated ☺
@SpotifyCares USA
@SpotifyCares TYSM!!
@SpotifyCares Spotify App is listed in apps on my Facebook.  It says my Your Spotify User ID is __credit_card__
@SpotifyCares It's a desktop PC, windows 10. I just reinstalled Spotify app to see if that helped, but no. I click on a playlist, it seems to cycle 1/2
@SpotifyCares Through each track, then says track not available. No sound even on your suggested tracks. :(
@SpotifyCares Will do. Am in bed right now, as an in the UK, but will do as soon as I can. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares I saw the album was removed. Any ideas when it will be back on Spotify (under the correct Train)
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/ew4JBGk4KF
@SpotifyCares Along with the other 7k users that have actively gone to your community page and voted on this as a desired product/feature?
@SpotifyCares Their albums are all of Spotify US
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the info, it was very helpful!
@SpotifyCares this improves social aspect + allows you to see which of your friends like the same artist for going to concerts etc.
@SpotifyCares Even if I wouldn't have the messages and notes that my husband sent with all those songs.
@SpotifyCares I read this and I get the why. But it would've been great to know it was going to happen so I could make a playlist of the songs.
@SpotifyCares Actually I see username is janetburke07 and email is __email__
@SpotifyCares But now that I deleted it I can’t log in at all. Please email me and I can explain.

@SpotifyCares It really doesn't seem like "spotify cares" at all.  I bet you'd never let this problem persist this long on an apple device.
@SpotifyCares Well I hear the same song several times a day on a playlist of ~800 songs, and only several albums. It actually seems worse now than before
@SpotifyCares Updated 2016?  all of the comments after are the same complaint. I feel like the shuffle picks specific songs to tempt free users using (1)
@SpotifyCares some algorithm, then doesn't change it to be truly random for premium users like myself. Whether or not that is the case, which I'd bet (2)
@SpotifyCares it is, I'm paying what little disposable income I have in college to listen to the same few songs over and over in SHUFFLE. (3)
@SpotifyCares If improvements are not made soon, I'm switching to google play music or something that actually works. (4/4)
@SpotifyCares The last update from Spotify is from August. With all of the recent comments, it appears you’re OK with hemorrhaging subscribers for this.
@SpotifyCares Nevermind I figured it out
@SpotifyCares I did not sign up using Facebook
@SpotifyCares Okay will I️t come back on my playlists? How will i know if it’s back
@SpotifyCares Eight years and you still don’t have a real answer?!
@SpotifyCares No
@SpotifyCares I’m having issue with my subscription services and I’m quite sure you don’t want it on a public forum. I’m using iPhone iOS 11
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Just reached out. (Now, who do I talk to about getting those songs onto a playlist?)
@SpotifyCares It is the same problem when iOS launched version 11 I’ll think you fixed the problem afterwards, because until a few days ago it worked fine
@SpotifyCares I’m still having issues
@SpotifyCares 😂😂😂😂 Well played Spotify, well played!
@SpotifyCares latest TestFlight version seems to have resolved the odd behaviour I used to see but can’t really tell for sure at this point. I’ll keep in touch through DM.
@SpotifyCares It was a joke looooool we good
@SpotifyCares oh yeah, signing up with facebook doesn't work neither
@SpotifyCares __email__
@SpotifyCares @589099 Having the same problem bought family premium 4+ hours ago but restarting is not working
@SpotifyCares It is fixed, thanks for attention.
@SpotifyCares I can’t DM you currently, there’s no option to.
@SpotifyCares @147836 Yes, there is a beta and many people on the very thread you directed me to is commenting about it along with pics. Thread started 5 yrs ago.
@SpotifyCares Artist: spotify:artist:78XLiUvZTJiY3Sj0nIZRou

@SpotifyCares https://t.co/cXLYDzweKI
@SpotifyCares Great thanks. I'm a bit confused on the same address section. Can I not add my brother then if we don't share the same address?
@SpotifyCares One last question. I originally created my account from my Facebook profile which doesn't have my address. Will that be an issue?
@SpotifyCares I dont want this app !
@SpotifyCares Sounds too spoopy for me
@SpotifyCares @117168 @116130 @116380 @7997 @125633 @117153 @12955 @118266 Thank you for your response! I tried logging out and logging back in, and it’s still the same. Many others are having the same issue.
@SpotifyCares It works. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares SO I was joining the family plan, typed in all info including the correct address.  It showed error 3 - oops something went wrong
@SpotifyCares Why do they still show, and how can I delete them finally? When trying to edit the playlist in the client, the two songs don't appear.
@SpotifyCares I solved it in the meantime. But thanks for reaching out!
@SpotifyCares tagging you @148611 please assist. thanks :)
@SpotifyCares Not really, I've tried all my usual ones. If there's a private forum I can provide credit card receipts and such though
@SpotifyCares They made a playlist and everything and keep on interrupting me I want them gone
@SpotifyCares Please help i just go premium I had to change my password twice today I just want to listen to imagine dragons
@SpotifyCares I work for one of the colleges; it would make more sense to have the entire @62599 set of colleges included.
@SpotifyCares also what are the privacy regulations for uploading a picture of my school id? i think thats highly ridiculous if an email url can suffice.
@SpotifyCares Doesn’t let me choose songs etc how come?
@SpotifyCares How can I change my account's country setting? Does it changes automatically depending on the ip address being used atm?
@SpotifyCares Will you reply to my dm!
@SpotifyCares Honestly, I may not even resubscribe, because I don’t want to have to build all that back up.
@SpotifyCares This has been absurdly absurdly frustrating. Wasted an enormous amount of time, and, and, I get to lose all my playlists and likes
@SpotifyCares The idea has been posted and ignored several times. Would be a welcome change for Rememberance Day #LestWeForget #SupportTheTroops
@SpotifyCares Oh you guys are so sweet. Same for you! What I noticed is that songs keep appearing over and over again in a short time while I got 2k songs
@SpotifyCares I’ll DM you, I don’t want to offend people who love this wretched song 😒
@SpotifyCares This is another Bible that WAS avail in the USA, @SpotifyCares Bible – CEV New Testament - Contemporary English Version (Dramatized) Thanks.
@SpotifyCares ? https://t.co/Araht00hk4
@SpotifyCares To be fair it could be the horrible iOS update
@SpotifyCares I have been asking for a year 🙄🙄
@SpotifyCares @593246 
@593247
@SpotifyCares Tried Solution: -Clear Cookies, Open in Incognito, Change Devices. Exactly same address. None of these help.
@SpotifyCares @115888 Every week I go into work and find I can't listen to any of my music because the app decided to just get rid of every song
@SpotifyCares So that's a no then?
@SpotifyCares Already done. I know it must be a complicated process but launching in India is taking an awfully long time.
@SpotifyCares Thanks I still love you https://t.co/b6sgVo62F2
@SpotifyCares My new release was posted under the wrong artist profile. Waiting for it to be fixed. 10 days ago was told it may take a few days to show up
@SpotifyCares I was going to start my subscription again but now I'm not
@SpotifyCares I'm getting close to shutting down my current Spotify and starting over.
@SpotifyCares Apple Music's limit is 100,000 songs. I would've understood if your response was that it's not economically feasible but it seems you lied
@SpotifyCares Nope the app neva crashed. I am at the gym and every 6-10 min there is an advert. The same adverts over and over. Some party in a field.
@SpotifyCares I didnt physically look at my phone but it went watch this video for 30min free... Played video i hear it and then it goes thanks now enjoy.
@SpotifyCares Like i says im in the gym when i use Spotify. So im listening to stuff and i dont mind the odd advert. But its become more than music. 😤
@SpotifyCares No figured it out. I have to pay for premium in order to listen on my phone.
@SpotifyCares My questions is why is that the only way?
@SpotifyCares "We're having trouble authorizing your account with Spotify. Please contact Spotify support to help resolve this issue."
@SpotifyCares i have but they either respond and don't do anything or just don't respond
@SpotifyCares Managed to fix it by changing password.... dunno what happened there.... anychance you guys can change my username please
@SpotifyCares @597977 We really shouldn’t have to vote for you to update your app...
@SpotifyCares USA! that really sucks I need to get to the bottom of this
@SpotifyCares Been through all the articles. Nothing helps. Can I speak with a person?
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I use iOS 11.1 and Spotify 8.4.25.906, but I have an iPhone X and the size of the screen is different so there are black spaces at
@SpotifyCares I already reinstall and download all my playlist again.
@SpotifyCares Could you please direct me to a resource to reset. This is an account based in Turkey
@SpotifyCares I want to cancel my premium subscription so I can change my email for new Spotify acc. I hope you can help w/ my issue. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares I've sorted it thank you!
@SpotifyCares Well - I’m just now getting back to this. Can you guys still help?
@SpotifyCares however I can't login on Spotify Web - says my pwd is incorrect. I've changed it on FB settings but I still can't login. can you pls help?

@SpotifyCares it was on PC and mobile when you had issues a few days ago. All good now thanks!
@SpotifyCares Restarted and even reinstalled the app, same issue. I️ May have unauthenticated via Facebook, how can I️ reauthenticate?
@SpotifyCares This is on a windows desktop computer - both chrome and firefox I am having the same issue. I did try to clear my cookies and didn't work
@SpotifyCares Not sure if you can see at the bottom but the same 15 second NY State Lottery ad seems to be cued up and won't play, like the site is stuck. https://t.co/T7ldrcYkcg
@SpotifyCares USA this is the first time this has happened 😢
https://t.co/i1QC24qaf1
@SpotifyCares Varify me as a student and to check my details... #help
@SpotifyCares iPhone SE
IOS 11.1
Version 8.4.25.906

Thanks!
@SpotifyCares When connecting to WiFi it says I’m offline and to try again. 
It’s fine on 3/4g however, I don’t want it to eat my data constantly
@SpotifyCares Hi. Thanks. I have paid to changing my account into premium account, but turns out, my account is still free one. Pls advise.
@SpotifyCares What's the point of even paying for Premium if music is not going to be readily available for offline listening?
@SpotifyCares @117153 I removed the app and I re-download it and it works now :)
@SpotifyCares Any release time? Days? Weeks?
@SpotifyCares the latest of all Apple and you
@SpotifyCares iPh7, latest iOS and Spotify. happens on 3g also
@SpotifyCares Oh wait! Just got fixed!
@SpotifyCares it looks like my mac was to blame all along. i knew you guys wouldn't let me down
@SpotifyCares Yeah it's updated now. Not the best song choices though, please try harder next week 😁
@SpotifyCares @601683 So basically buy Apple Music if you want the new Apple Watch. Thanks, Spotify!
@SpotifyCares I'm the only verified Sinclair on there. Would love it if you wouldn't mind keeping extra eye on this one ? 😘thank u 🙏🏼
@SpotifyCares 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼
@SpotifyCares thank you!!!
@SpotifyCares Was I hacked????
@SpotifyCares Thanks it arrived eventually!
@SpotifyCares Thank you 🤗
@SpotifyCares I made the cut! Thank you! I'll enjoy this show!
@SpotifyCares Great non answer, you should be a politician
@SpotifyCares It's sorted now! Sorry!
@SpotifyCares @515263 Is this a problem with @515265 refusing to upgrade their firmware to support a new API or something like that?
@SpotifyCares But I still can't login with the new number from the country I live in. What do I do?
@SpotifyCares Are you willing to fix it?
@SpotifyCares I’m looking forward to it. Hope it’s sooner than later.
@SpotifyCares I actually had my student account expire two months ago, but I got it fixed now I subscribed to the bundle. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I know u guys have the school deal but what if your in high school or middle school where they let u listen to music and do work it helps
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/bGngoU2gqL
@SpotifyCares It has to do with billing can it be private message
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares it now wants me to upgrade to premium even though the only account I have is linked to my Starbucks partner numbers
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/wVtZdn0n4M this is the one it keeps playing/ is pointing to
@SpotifyCares iphone 6, 10.3.3, Spotify premium (not sure if that is what you mean by version). Thanks!
@SpotifyCares 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares I do wish labels would have their own tab or something though. This is my favorite music discovery tool.
@SpotifyCares It updated yesterday so the latest. I can’t remember if I’ve tried from my phone. Will do
@SpotifyCares How do I get my playlists, radio and discovery functions working on Roku?
@SpotifyCares It's seriously annoying when I travel
@SpotifyCares I appreciate the response, although none of these troubleshooting suggestions apply to me.
@SpotifyCares There's only a few albums on Spotify but Apple Music, TIDAL and others tend to have their full discography.
@SpotifyCares Agggh that's pretty frustrating. Thanks for the response though!
@SpotifyCares @16134 WHY SPOTIFY IS SHOWING ME THIS MESSAGE WHEN I WANT TO PLAY MY MUSICS AAA??? https://t.co/9wgwJZ0LTC
@SpotifyCares Just had a really nice chat with @SpotifyCares. They could help me to fix my problem 😊 Thank you guys!
@SpotifyCares It’s working now
@SpotifyCares Thanks. A suggestion, if I may: auto-play songs from albums in the Discover section. Those tend to be good recommendations.
@SpotifyCares Downloads and saved library both lost with the update. I use a Samsung A5
@SpotifyCares Samsung A520W, android 7.0, spotify 8.4.25.771
@SpotifyCares This is the fourth time this has happened to me across two devices
@SpotifyCares @447511 Come on guys! A huge company like @115888 should have prepared an app update for iPhone X way before launch. iOS 11 beta had been out for months before public launch... And it's not like iPhone X was a surprise either...
@SpotifyCares I don’t even use Spotify b 😥
@SpotifyCares I have restarted and the problem is still there.
@SpotifyCares The music pauses. And sometimes I will go into the spotify app and a song will immediately start playing before I press play. I have had no problems with spotify until I got my new samsung s7 so wondering if it could be the operating system or some other setting?
@SpotifyCares Hi there, thanks for the link. There is a LOT of noise about this from your users. I hope you all are taking this seriously as a priority. Alexa is the number one way I consume Spotify and if you don't fix it soon I will have to switch to Amazon Music.
@SpotifyCares @115888 Even worse, the AD isn't related to what I listen
Isn't supposed that @115888 #tracks all the user preferences in order to tailor content?
@SpotifyCares It’s been going on for a month. My wife can barely listen at all because of hijacking. https://t.co/vLOGC48rcW
@SpotifyCares I prefer to delete the message when all this is resolved
@SpotifyCares Thanks my account's username is Alejandra Aptera and the email address is __email__
@SpotifyCares Bummer! What a great feature.
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much. I'm using a MacBook Pro w/ El Capitan and the family Spotify plan.
@SpotifyCares Especially if that person already has the desktop Spotify app open and is logged in!
@SpotifyCares @604193 Better pass that suggestion faster
@SpotifyCares I got logged out and now when i try to log back in, it say i am experiancing problems try later
@SpotifyCares Actually, it looks like my premium account has expired.  Maybe that would cause this?
@SpotifyCares I just made a new email don't worry about it.
@SpotifyCares Not sure how to reset via Facebook if that's an option (that's how I logged in but I do have an email attached to the account). 2/2
@SpotifyCares Here is a screenshot - i've tried a few diff cards and i get the same response every time https://t.co/AMURkY01UO
@SpotifyCares Thank you!  As a paying customer it is very valuable to me to have it.
@SpotifyCares Thank you! I listen all the time and wish I could listen to what I want rather than what "I think I may like" my playlists would be great.
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares, can anything be done about the past charges and can I pleeeeaase cancel.  It has been made very difficult to do
@SpotifyCares A frend have deactivate the preminium account for us
@SpotifyCares Already have! It is now set as “not right now”. Even though you purchased the watch app Spotty and dev behind it like a year ago 😭
@SpotifyCares I’m using the last version of Chrome, and it only happens on my chromebook. Not on my phone
@SpotifyCares it stops every 2/4 minutes and then I have to restart the whole browser :/
@SpotifyCares Hmmm... whatever works I guess. In-app would be handier.
@SpotifyCares It is very unfortunate we can't share the love with fellow Spotifiers. You did bad here.
@SpotifyCares Downloaded for offline use.
@SpotifyCares Yes thanks clearing that up
@SpotifyCares Hello, I’m not receiving any error message. I click on certain songs and they simply will not play even though I have a premium account
@SpotifyCares 8.4.23.784 armV7
I'm going to try again with android 'battery optimization' disabled for spotify.
@SpotifyCares No change. It's this Nexus 5X, it's garbage.
@SpotifyCares This is fresh from a factory reset on Monday. Not trying.
@SpotifyCares @166758 The primary reason I switched to Spotify was so that I could see my data in @70156.
@SpotifyCares You made changed in Feb of 2016.  I’ve only been using Spotify since March of 2017, so that change was already implemented.
@SpotifyCares I don't see how voting on a topic that's been open for 5 years will move this along. @129941 lets you change votes...
@SpotifyCares Done. Thank you! I would love to have a Spotify app that is standalone on the series 3 watch.
@SpotifyCares @510335 We can view the stats pages but there hasn't been data updates since Sept. 23. Maybe related?
@SpotifyCares I like this animation
@SpotifyCares I don't have account with you but money is going out my bank? Who can help?
@SpotifyCares yeah mate im aware i just want it back
@SpotifyCares Ah, ok, thanks
@SpotifyCares I hope someday we can hear them
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much, while that I will hear the other musics available in your awesome service
@SpotifyCares Thanks, why not have remove from playlist in the now playing?...tbh I only use one other from that long list of options
@SpotifyCares I made my own playlist and I want to make it public so other people can listen to my playlist
@SpotifyCares @160530 how long will this stay bundled bc yall want a credit card number, so as soon as this is discontinued I dont want to get charged! Thaaanks
@SpotifyCares How do I go about recovering my account?
@SpotifyCares All these Podcasts are, for some reason, 2 seconds long. Not intentionally. Xperia Z5, latest android and Spotify updates.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the speedy response! Links below.

https://t.co/mvBz4qFrmC
@SpotifyCares haha. keep trying! those albums are the epitome of fall in the PNW! :)
@SpotifyCares good to hear! thanks for the quick response!
@SpotifyCares No error codes. On my phone whenever I select a frank song whatever’s playing stops and the bar on the bottom disappears
@SpotifyCares Still doesn't work on my phone &amp; on my comp it says "This song is not available. If you have the file on your computer you can import it."
@SpotifyCares @160530 So i already have spotify student and a few nights a go i renewed my hulu account so how do i merge the two?
@SpotifyCares @160530 So if I just have normal premium do I get Hulu? Or is it only for students?
@SpotifyCares Would be great lol
@SpotifyCares Well I use a ZTE Max XL but I'm not very sure about what you mean for everything else so here's a screenshot if it's any help https://t.co/1waRzp2iBD
@SpotifyCares There is still no option to cancel
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your reply however none of those steps are relevant to me, I’m regularly online with the latest version using only my phone to listen to Spotify. Any other suggestions?
@SpotifyCares description of payment is Spotify P03893955E, but I never registred my card, so it might be hacked or I dont know.
@SpotifyCares WTF is this spotiamb 2.0.1? Solve this sh*t or I will cancel my account in 48 hours.
@SpotifyCares Das why I'm saying thank you for suggestion new sad music I can cry to
@SpotifyCares how do you get to the last one?
@SpotifyCares helppppp 😭😩
@SpotifyCares I have a complaint so you try to sell me spotify premium lol wtf
@SpotifyCares Don't mind ads but 4 in a row is a no no
@SpotifyCares Possible fixing it smoothly somehow?
@SpotifyCares Time to implement is not the issue, the issue is your lack of response and customer service.
@SpotifyCares I've reset the application, redownloaded it 3 times, as well resetting my PC, and the application is not loading, its just blank. https://t.co/TMj97GxBlL
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares pls help me its killing me, i need spotify in my daily activities 😭😭
@SpotifyCares @170356 ‘Not right now’ was stated in August. Why is it difficult to release one, if Apple can do it?Health &amp; music without mobile @80387
@SpotifyCares thank you and have a good day!
@SpotifyCares Seeing "reloading" every few seconds. Current app unusable.
@SpotifyCares Please look into this issue
@SpotifyCares I'd like to clarify that I am on a UK student premium acc that's due to expire, and as I'm back in M'sia I'd like to get on my family's plan
@SpotifyCares What about my song list? There's no the button.. https://t.co/W5EIi1VrOF
@SpotifyCares Since then, I resigned up, can I be refunded for the month I was charged full price?
@SpotifyCares okay :/  thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Did Webchat and they sorted it. I'd been hacked.
@SpotifyCares Ya les envié DM pero aún no tengo ningún tipo de respuesta!
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.515 Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Hey no error screens - but volume buttons on my phone literally don’t respond unless I have app pulled up. Never used to happen
@SpotifyCares That fixed it! Thanks a ton. Great servicing experience.
@SpotifyCares on my phone nothing shows up it just doesnt play, my pc shows this https://t.co/Ms9lfjVJB5
@SpotifyCares nothing changed ):
@SpotifyCares I'm a poor college student in need of a partial refund so I can buy food LOL
@SpotifyCares lol no i just h8 commercials can i have unlimited for free?
@SpotifyCares Nope, it actually continued with ads after watching the video
@SpotifyCares Yep! All good though, still listening to Spotify and still love the app, just weird cuz it's never happened before
@SpotifyCares this happens to be every few months. Pls help
@SpotifyCares no error messages, and an iPhone 6 version 8.4.20.535
@SpotifyCares Dude i'm an anonymous bitchface, i ain't giving you my details!
@SpotifyCares Awesome, love my #Spotify Thanks for the reach out 😃
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply. People are starting to get fed up with this answer. A little communication would go a long way. It's been over a year
@SpotifyCares Any update on this?
@SpotifyCares Will I have to repurchase the student discount? It’s asking me to put in my card. Will I be charged? I already have Premium
@SpotifyCares Hey there, it’s been another month. Please DM me a phone number so I can alert a real person to this
@SpotifyCares Ok. But this is getting old fast
@SpotifyCares Heyyyy @SpotifyCares, it's been a couple weeks and this error is still there. Do you really care?
@SpotifyCares I’m using my computer. Also the version I’m using I beleive is something like 1.0.65.320. If thats not it, where do I find the version #?
@SpotifyCares There haven’t been any yet
@SpotifyCares reezal93 that's my username and my account's email address is __email__
@SpotifyCares Sabi ko pakilagay na ung taylor swift reputation hano tnx
@SpotifyCares UPDATE: FRANK IS PLAYING AGAIN. ALL IS WELL. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
@SpotifyCares Do you have to put it in a playlist or can you just download whole song library?
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares Resolved my own issue.  We had to add her phone and device in her profile on the web app. Don't remember having to do this before.  Either way, we're all good now :-).
@SpotifyCares I’ve also checked for Spotify and iOS updates.
@SpotifyCares It’s not even songs with the same/similar names. I’ve restarted my phone and redownloaded the app.
@SpotifyCares You a hoe @115888 I’m going to Apple Music
@SpotifyCares Wtf https://t.co/opHjabTDRF
@SpotifyCares Thanks. We shall see. I almost picture it'd be better as a slide on album art like the genius lyrics look.
@SpotifyCares If you can't remove it, is there a way I could censor that ad or can you at least limit the number of times it plays?
@SpotifyCares This issue has been around for years and yet the only update we've received is "we are aware of the situation". That's a non-answer.
@SpotifyCares Thanks but that didn’t answer WHY there’s a limit. I have 16gb free on my phone and want to download at least 5,555 songs not 3,333.
@SpotifyCares I have already sign up
@SpotifyCares Thanks Spotify for taking care of this! Y'all the best ❤️
@SpotifyCares I can't update them until I have the new card sent as I don't yet know the number etc
@SpotifyCares Lyrics are Still unavailable lol
@SpotifyCares I changed to free a few months ago.  Is this new as it hasn't happened to me previously whilst using free?
@SpotifyCares playlists are fine it's only the albums
@SpotifyCares Why would you take that away? Why.
@SpotifyCares Yep it was none of them to my knowledge. Offline mode was turned off so wasn't that and the app is the most recent. It was working at 1am?
@SpotifyCares Yes I did and then I was in correspondence with a member of your team, but nothing has changed.
@SpotifyCares I'd like a refund
@SpotifyCares Good morning. I have a family acount. the two accounts of my family have gone to Free. What should I do ?

@SpotifyCares @614665 RECIÉN VEO ESTO POR DIOS QUE MARAVILLA
@SpotifyCares @115888 I don't listen to German songs and yet constantly I get like 3-4 songs on each weekly playlist, is there a way to stop this? So annoying 😕
@SpotifyCares and some hack songs come up using my boy @240986 name??
@SpotifyCares recently and my login info has been saved on my old phone for years. its a premium account
@SpotifyCares I am trying to sign up to the Spotify/students but it says that my email is already in use. 1/2
@SpotifyCares then when I go to that account associated with my email, it won’t let me use it as a student 2/2
@SpotifyCares All downloaded songs were removed
@SpotifyCares my account
@SpotifyCares I also force closed the app, which stopped the download until I reopened the app again.
@SpotifyCares Samsung Galaxy S7
Android 7.0 Nougat
Spotify 8.4.22.857 armV7
@SpotifyCares Online when I'm connected to the Internet, when I press connect it just doesn't respond so I can't log in. Thanks!
Luckily @SpotifyCares are amazing. Here I am less than 10 minutes later with full access and my account is secure

@SpotifyCares Hi, thanks for the reply, I'm using a Moto X(2015) on android 7.0, Spotify ver. 8.4.22.857
@SpotifyCares Then I’m canceling premium
@SpotifyCares OK thanks, just annoyed I have used up a lot of my data allowance for this month as I hadn't realised. I assumed they were offline forever
@SpotifyCares Your music is playing at 3x speed here in Oahu that’s what
@SpotifyCares Um fix your problem.  How about that.
@SpotifyCares It's okay mate! I solved it thanks for the assist
@SpotifyCares Lol 
Few months back you had told me that you will launching real soon?
@SpotifyCares Thanks for th consideration! :)
@SpotifyCares Can someone respond
@SpotifyCares you’re support guys have fixed it now. Thx
@SpotifyCares Windows 10 and Spotify version 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3. I believe it was the "Your Time Capsule" playlist that bugged out.
@SpotifyCares A login and restart did not resolve the issue. I've checked my other devices as well and the problem persists across all of them. https://t.co/i3QuTyuTUF
@SpotifyCares Like this, all of my playlist is not complete but the playlist folder written is complete. Why ? https://t.co/9YnicXmxJA
@SpotifyCares Exactly my song in playlist disappeared, I don’t know where is it. in my playlist folder is wtitten complete example 30 song. But after I opened my playlist folder there are only 13 song
@SpotifyCares Yesterday i’ve upgrade my acc, my playlist not completely exist. But in the folder written complete, if i opened my folder just only few song in my playlist, how is it ?
@SpotifyCares Oh sweet! I'm using an iMac that's running Sierra 10.12.6 with Spotify 1.0.66.478.g1296534d. I guess that's the version number 🤔
@SpotifyCares Yeah! That helped actually. I also restated the application. Thanks! ✌️
@SpotifyCares It is ! Wow ^^ a thousand thanks ! Love you xoxo https://t.co/ThOxu9j94F
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the attention you give me :) I live in France
@SpotifyCares Thank you! My cat really liked that song...
@SpotifyCares Thanks so much 😊 https://t.co/f2d7lwZZ7u
@SpotifyCares Of course it’s shuffleyerfeet
@SpotifyCares done ! just sent the DM. thanks !
@SpotifyCares mac book pro 15" 2016 model. spotify 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02.
@SpotifyCares okay, here it's happening again: https://t.co/K8yCvOe0om
@SpotifyCares it's not doing it now. i will try if it starts up again. it was the bottom bar and it was flashing sort of irregularly.
@SpotifyCares Will you guys fix it later on for people could get their desired username
@SpotifyCares That post is 5 years old and still no alarm tho 😩
@SpotifyCares 😢
@SpotifyCares @115888 Well, no major crash or anything, just the app not capable of handling a few tasks at once. Stuff doesn't load, some does, when I return, it doesn't anymore, ... You get the point. I close the app, restart the phone, bang, all downloads reset.
@SpotifyCares hi, it says that i'm 'unable to renew your subscription because of payment problem'. the premium fee supposed to be IDR 49.990. my balance is IDR 62.000, should be more than enough to automatically renew. pls help, thx
@SpotifyCares No issues so far! Thanks! 
Fuck @1124
@SpotifyCares Also happens on twitter
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8+, IOS 11.1, most recent Spotify version, no error messages.
@SpotifyCares I'm on Android 8.0.0, and app version 8.4.26.770 :)
@SpotifyCares Thank you ; w ;
@SpotifyCares Oooo closing the app and opening it again worked! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares V 8.4.25.771 armV7, Android. Honestly nothing big, just that pages take time to reload when returning from one.
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you for your quick responses, I can't wait to see how the Spotify Team takes use of that extra screen space on the iPhone X!
@SpotifyCares Is there at least some sort of timeframe of when it might get supported? The black bars are not very appealing for the gorgeous display of the iPhone X.
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you very much!!
@SpotifyCares And here's a video to document the problem: https://t.co/weGVOYlrx0
@SpotifyCares I already sent u several screen shots. This must mean you have no idea what your doing and all my efforts have been wasted so far
@SpotifyCares STOP BEING SO WORTHLESS AND READ MY PREVIOUS MESSAGES. I'VE BEEN A PAYING CUSTOMER FOR MANY YEARS, YOU ARE THE WORST SERVICE EVER
@SpotifyCares Doesn't. The issue happens when I'm listening on my phone and the interruptions aren't from my web player. It's random stuff.
@SpotifyCares I hope so! Thanks for the response
@SpotifyCares Your company, your rules.  Just know you aren’t the only choice for streaming.
@SpotifyCares Where is the Iphone X support update??
@SpotifyCares thank you!!
@SpotifyCares oh okay, thank you! 😊
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares at least I know not to hold out hope you'll add more #JoAnnKelly albums. Or #UniversalJones.
@SpotifyCares Hint: The lyrics match up with the track titles. https://t.co/QnFwcXovxM
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/GmNE8aNSTf
@SpotifyCares Win10 Desktop &amp; store app. Android7 app. The green wheel spins for atleast 5 min or more before the entries load. Done everything, clear data+cache, reinstall, tested on a newly reset device, re-log-in.
@SpotifyCares Nope. Wifi1, wifi2, 4g, lan, router restart. Recently reset my desktop, 1 month &amp;, Spotify is slow again, &amp; story is same for few years now.
@SpotifyCares Yeah I know... why do you guys have that limit ?? I love music and listen to tons and reached the limit the other day and now I’m not sure what to do... is there any way to save more than 10,000 songs ??
@SpotifyCares That works. I just miss the functionality to select "shuffle" when first opening a playlist, the way it used to be.
@SpotifyCares thanks but ill just go ahead and download the soundcloud app
@SpotifyCares I sent to your artist services using the email __email__
@SpotifyCares Spotify—this issue is still not rectified ... what’s going on
@SpotifyCares I did that. No one is helping me with this ... can you please reach out to your artists service team and let me know what the status is? It’s a pretty simple request!
@SpotifyCares Sure but twitter won’t let me unless you follow my twitter I think.
@SpotifyCares Done.
@SpotifyCares It did not change anything. I believe there was an update last week? I forget. I tried changing storage to internal, says that something may be wrong with my SD card, but, it seems to work with everything else just fine.
@SpotifyCares T-Mobile LG G5 (LG-H830) on Android 7.0. The issue just started yesterday. I don't currently have a different SD card with me.
@SpotifyCares Yup. Tried that. Tried reformatting my SD card. Nothing.
@SpotifyCares I'm using Asus Zenfone 5, it's Android 4.3 (?) and my current Spotify version is 8.4.26.770 x86. Id the problem where I choose to storage the downloads? But I can't seem to change it (where I want to storage it).
@SpotifyCares It's finally working (the downloads) because I removed stuff from my SD card to internal storage. I don't know why it won't let me change the option to storing songs on internal storage which have more space than my SD card.
@SpotifyCares okay, thank you!
@SpotifyCares but will 'reputation' be available on spotify as soon as it gets released?
@SpotifyCares Thanks for getting back to me. That’s very disappointing to hear that. But I stand with that user, we need a dislike button 😭 I DISLIKE FRANK.
@SpotifyCares It's necessary? I used OS X Captain and works fine! I don't like SIERRA :(.
Any other solution?
@SpotifyCares it does not work! What happened!!???Just stay charging! :( https://t.co/VuAe6G6ynU
@SpotifyCares Its working now. :D
@SpotifyCares Hey. I have an iphone 6s. iOS 11.1. spotify version 8.4.25.906.

Other people listening to this album are having an issue with specific song as well.
@SpotifyCares It’s avalible on my laptop but not on mobile
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/Yfv15KfbVF
@SpotifyCares It's the images you serve in relation to artist. Albums OK. Pat Metheny Group shows image of Pat Metheny Unity Group.  They aren't the same.
@SpotifyCares Great! Thank you 😊
@SpotifyCares Sorry. Spotify doens't care.
https://t.co/hpqDzW1waW
@SpotifyCares hell yea boi thanks again! 😍
@SpotifyCares So I will get an email if they ever add it to the list or will they tell me if I am eligible for this discount ?
@SpotifyCares yes it happened on both devices. For now it's okay though (not jinxing it x.x). Restart / incognito aso didn't change a thing.
@SpotifyCares This seems to have worked, thank you!
@SpotifyCares I'm taking my talents to live nation thanks
@SpotifyCares Wow, what determined being the "biggest fan"? That should've been stipulated, there's a lot of upset fans now
@SpotifyCares No, that does not help. This is a well documented issue, even on the Spotify community boards. I suggest you look into it ASAP as there are many very unhappy customers.
@SpotifyCares Fair enough. https://t.co/D7MwhgzqT5
@SpotifyCares Daaaamn. Props to your social media department. Responding with a fairly deep cut song.
@SpotifyCares Yeah your algorithm sucks. I listen to them all day everyday on Spotify. But it’s okay i guessed the code and got tickets 🤗
@SpotifyCares Pacer by The Amps. Thanks for the reply, despite the horrible pun :)
@SpotifyCares But I don’t have a credit card nor paypal :/ .. when the pay via itunes will be apply?
@SpotifyCares I see it's available on Samsung watches, as standalone, so really hope to see it coming Wear.
@SpotifyCares Tried to listen to music, #spotify keeps saying to check my connection. I'm on house Wi-Fi. Groove opens fine &amp; plays.
@SpotifyCares Lumia 650, w10m
@SpotifyCares Referred phone and the playlists open now.  See how it is in the morning
@SpotifyCares alright thank you!
@SpotifyCares I just did it. It didn't work and it's done this before on another account. I'm about to have my 19th nervous breakdown with this app
@SpotifyCares -_-
@SpotifyCares for DVSN plsss and thank you
@SpotifyCares Thanks a lot @SpotifyCares 😬
@SpotifyCares Yeah! I’m on iOS9, on an iPhone 5s. I can ‘View Artist’, but there’s no option for ‘View Album’. I remember it used to be there!
@SpotifyCares Anyway, that's not something that prevents me to use spotify, just an annoyance. Count this as a +1 on that issue card you probably have "better management of cached files" :)
@SpotifyCares Hi guys, thanks for the link. I already clean my cache regularly (~ every month), but I would love not to have to do that :) (thus, automatically cleaning old cached files). I'm on nexus, so I can't use a SD, sadly. Plus, app doesn't need that much data for real.
@SpotifyCares To verify new pass via email, but i didnt received any. Can you help me to solve this? My username is sheilawasito . Thanks! (2)
@SpotifyCares Thanks, but I'm not holding my breath, this feature has been requested on your forums for several years
@SpotifyCares iOS 11 on the iPhone 6s https://t.co/4q8m2T0odp
@SpotifyCares thanks for quick reply problem send by DM
@SpotifyCares I have a contactperson now by Spotyfy
@SpotifyCares problem solved
@SpotifyCares thank you!!!😄 #BTOB_Brother_Act
@SpotifyCares @624526 Heyyy look at your DM, please!!!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response--

Tracks I've downloaded to my iPhone for offline playback don't play when selected. Clicking on the affected tracks does nothing.
@SpotifyCares I got it! I’ve had Spotify for like 4 years 🙌🏾
@SpotifyCares Thanks, it... sort of helped. Now why does my music pause every so often, and I have to reset the app to fix it? I have an s8, so it's not like I'm on an old phone, that barely works.
@SpotifyCares El oh el so based on the fact of if I️ listen to them via your app vs purchasing their album like i did because I️ like to own my music. 👍🏾
@SpotifyCares Okay. Thanks, I guess?
@SpotifyCares Fingers crossed! Thanks for the quick response!
@SpotifyCares Just the albums my playlists are ok.
@SpotifyCares it's labeled in the title bar as being by Luther Vandross but it's sang by Joe McElderry.
@SpotifyCares the update is over a year old &amp; does not work
@SpotifyCares How is that determined? I️ listen to them everyday.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for there response. I did log out and restart. Seems to be working again. I’ll let you know if it breaks. I appreciate you sending a possible fix.
@SpotifyCares Thanks.
@SpotifyCares No, thanks. 🙂 My problem about Spotify was clear!
@SpotifyCares The band hasn't made an album since 2008 and disbanded in 2013, I can't imagine why there would be a sudden issue with music that has been on Spotify for literal years.
@SpotifyCares I discover lots of new music this way, which is lovely, but I can't see who's playing :D Any ideas welcome, as turning off screen lock means that I keep calling people as I'm singing in the car :(
@SpotifyCares Done, if this doesn't work I'm looking at hardware replacement, so either way it's problem solved. Thank you for your assistance #realsupport
@SpotifyCares Spotify continues to work, and the only way to make the phone to work is to pull the battery. I tested everything and if Spotify is running and the phone locks, I can't unlock it again. Good news, my playlist continues to play.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/Fkawmf5u4V
@SpotifyCares Bout a week ago. And no to all the above
@SpotifyCares Just confirmed it's the same problem on my desktop. When the animations are off, it uses %1, when on up to 10%. Makes the app useless.
@SpotifyCares Great. Now I can't listen to my favorite playlist. 🤦‍♂️
@SpotifyCares Lenovo yoga 900, windows 10, version 1.0.66.478.g1296534d. again, the idle animation is super unnecessary
@SpotifyCares Yes, does not last longer than 15-20 minutes on most occasions, I’ve tracked it before
@SpotifyCares No, it did not...
@SpotifyCares Yes...
@SpotifyCares Received - Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thank you.
@SpotifyCares yay thanks! i really miss it!
@SpotifyCares I force-closed the app and opened it back up. It’s back to normal now. Hopefully just a one time thing. If it happens again I’ll let you guys know. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8 Plus. App is up to date.
@SpotifyCares I don't have my macbook with me at the moment but the issue fixed itself after a reboot
@SpotifyCares Two playlists, 612 songs...
@SpotifyCares WiFi. I don’t use cellular. I have 150mbs internet so it’s not an issue on my end.
@SpotifyCares Never going back to Pandora. SPOTIFY has my ♥️
@SpotifyCares Any update @SpotifyCares ? this is starting to cost me too much, please fix the issue or I'll give @GooglePlayMusic another go.
@SpotifyCares I have, no difference in behaviour
@SpotifyCares Hello! Ive written but no one answered me back. ?!? How long does it take for them to answer ?
@SpotifyCares Ironic that not all students can benefit from the student discount. Not everyone has a credit card. Anyway I hope this will be solved thnks
@SpotifyCares Whoaaaaa k cool tu💖
@SpotifyCares thank you
@SpotifyCares I’m Sad Now. 😭 Thanks For The Help Though !!!
@SpotifyCares it's an LG G4, OS android 6.0, version 8.4.26.770 armV7
@SpotifyCares But I mean. Will you have it first week? Because it’s confirmed not in any streaming services 😅
@SpotifyCares I’m sorry, but that’s simply not good enough.  If you expect to compete with Apple Music, this should have been out on launch day.  Seriously, if this isn’t fixed before my next bill is due, I will be switching.
@SpotifyCares I'm using an LG Stylo(Android). I made a playlist with Wake Me Up by Remy Ma &amp; Lil Kim and also tried to play Took Us a Break by Lil Kim and it's the same thing. Do I have to buy Premium to hear these songs?
@SpotifyCares No it just moves on to the next song related to the artist
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/mjYJArzXl8
@SpotifyCares already read that in hopes of finding info on recovering archived conversations. but thanks.
@SpotifyCares Hey Spotify! 
Thanks for the response! What I️ meant was @466945 killed the game with her new album #unapologetically &amp; my @115888 account wont let me stream it after about the 10th time through. So I️ was being snarky about my “problem” . Lol 
KBs biggest fan, Laura
@SpotifyCares i️ love u guys you’re the best!!!!
@SpotifyCares Awww hello!! it's on my phone, laptop and office computer, not sure the OS 😂😄
@SpotifyCares No worries. 👍🏻 I’m using an iPhone 6s Plus with 11.1 and Spotify 8.4.25.906 and a pair of QuietComfort 35s. It first happened yesterday and then again today, if that helps.
@SpotifyCares the US
@SpotifyCares thank you sis sorry for my language 😔👌🏼💕
@SpotifyCares It’s not something I’d like to see, it’s something that should have happened for launch day! Don’t you think?
@SpotifyCares That would have been better than that copy and paste crap you started with! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Another app updated, no iPhone X full screen support. What the hell are you guys playing at?!?! You’re a massive company, even the small app companies have iPhone X full screen support. You need to up your game right away or I’m going to simply switch to Apple Music. Disgusting!
@SpotifyCares Sure, but it’s just disgusting really, don’t you think? It’s been over a week since the iPhone X launched and you’ve not enabled support for its new screen. Lots and other smaller companies/apps have. It’s just like a slap in the face to be honest given we pay for your app.
@SpotifyCares Another Spotify update for the iPhone app, still no iPhone X edge to edge screen support. If we don’t have this by Friday, I’m cancelling and switching to Apple Music, this is ridiculous now. Two weeks the phone has been out on Friday. Disgusting and incompetent!
@SpotifyCares Everytime I get out of my car and get back in yes, my playlist starts over
@SpotifyCares Version 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares Bluetooth, no. And it’s not just me. My wife’s phones does the exact same thing
@SpotifyCares the same thing happens :(
@SpotifyCares Thanks for looking into it. Not a big deal, but when driving - it's easier to have the Top 10-15 songs at your fingertips than just the top 5. Thanks again.
@SpotifyCares I immediately regret not calling it Now That's What I Call Customer Service vol. 33
@SpotifyCares im in the usa! the artist name is btob and the album name is complete every other album the artist has came out with is on spotify except for this one.
@SpotifyCares I am talking about your desktop app for windows 10. It is really slow. Not restarting my comp for an app.
@SpotifyCares No. It happened again. Taking ages to load and finally my computer seized up. I am removing your win 10 app. There is something wrong with it.
@SpotifyCares I need my app to work like it’s supposed to lol. Been really laggy, wont play audio unless I restart app, music won’t stop playing when I disconnect Bluetooth, etc etc.
@SpotifyCares Are you being sarcastic? How would *anyone* be looking for the now playing bar? I'm referring to the massive loss of functionality.
@SpotifyCares Like you guys said in the first tweet? There is no option on my phone.
But never mind, I fixed it on my pc. Thanks! 🙏
@SpotifyCares I’m greeted with this: https://t.co/DASDysviIh
@SpotifyCares Thank you for a prompt response:)
@SpotifyCares That's ashame with them being a UK based band. Thanks for the help. Spotify is the best!
@SpotifyCares That link is 5yrs old, update 1 yr old, the apathy makes no sense. I can’t let my 8yr old listen to Spotify so you’re missing out on plays.
@SpotifyCares Thanks.
You’re missing out on extra revenue and Apple Music can filter explicit songs.
@SpotifyCares I have this nice screen but the app I use the most doesn’t support the screen
@SpotifyCares I’m sorry for yelling I️ love you
@SpotifyCares Hey guys!  I️ use my iPhone 7 Plus, system 11.1 iOS system and Spotify version is 8.4.25.906.  Please let me know, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Yes, all playlists, specially since the update.  Before I had to click on shuffle button every time I turned on the car, but it would stay.  Now it doesn’t, and I️ use Bluetooth to connect...
@SpotifyCares Didn’t make a difference.  I️ can try again if you’d like...
@SpotifyCares Still not working after that...
@SpotifyCares &amp; it keeps saving random playlist I've never heard of and saying I'm streaming on some iphone did I wanna switch back to my device.
@SpotifyCares Except after the first time I changed my password and unlinked the tv I had hooked to stream. So why is it happening again.
@SpotifyCares Hey @SpotifyCares Please calibrate your robot. It doesn't fucking understand a fuck what I'm saying. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Sounds great, good teeth health is a true mean for happiness, m'not kiddin' ya! I love everything by Mike Patton; Tomahawk, Fantômas, Beak... anything from Ipecac recordings really. I'm going to bed now, thanks for the chat, good night!
@SpotifyCares Wow, thank you so much! 😊 there's even some pieces in there I never heard before. 👍
@SpotifyCares I'm using an iPhone 6 with iOS 10.3 &amp; I just updated my Spotify app
@SpotifyCares I restarted my phone and deleted and re downloaded the app and it still won't play
@SpotifyCares I use LTE and no it doesn't
@SpotifyCares No error messages, I just hit play and nothing happens on any device. No need to look into it.
@SpotifyCares Yes. Is that why? How can I make it stop besides not playing that music?
@SpotifyCares It's on my computer
@SpotifyCares Loooooll you call that your best then clearly it’s not. Someone’s not doing their job properly😩😩
@SpotifyCares Note, I have also tried doing this on several web browsers and to no avail, I still got the same message “please match requested format”
@SpotifyCares Sorry for late reply haha it's all sorted now thanks
@SpotifyCares Please please please please please please 🙌
@SpotifyCares I was told to go to that last time and it still doesn't mean anything to me.. it still doesn't make sense that two songs would be missing off an album
@SpotifyCares No, just playing a song and it stops mid song. I am using iPhoneX iOS 11.2 Spotify version 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares All of "Songs" disappeared. My playlists, albums, and artists were showing as there and downloaded. I updated to version 8.4.26.770 on my S8 last night. 
I restarted my phone 2x and it seems to be normal now.
@SpotifyCares But the fact is that I'm a student and I really would like to take advantage of the offer, I already tried several times and it didn'twork
@SpotifyCares Hey man, when did you add him? Why wasn't I the first one you told????
@SpotifyCares That doesn't tell me anything. Where has the option gone?
@SpotifyCares Why did you remove it???
@SpotifyCares Thanks does! Thank you for being competent!
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/KSgkDnN6qj these two are mixed up! :-)
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/liSOs0cies
@SpotifyCares Thank you, good people at Spotify. 🙏🏼
@SpotifyCares Or am I going to have to consider changing to android? 😫
@SpotifyCares Lol ..I thought I was... No worries I'll be be sure to scoop some tickets up still.😉 https://t.co/Kb4aYqYiWa
@SpotifyCares You're awesome. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares I need help, it won't let me sign in with my Facebook, says currently experiencing some problems
@SpotifyCares Well this is embarrassing but it’s playing now 👀 panic over!
@SpotifyCares well that's pretty lame considering I just imported my #groove library last week, and now I cant add anything...
@SpotifyCares Seems to have worked, thank you!
@SpotifyCares I’ve got an iPhone SE ios 11.1 and version 8.4.25 of the Spotify app
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!!
@SpotifyCares I Guess There Wont Be A Spotify App For The Apple Watch Any Time Soon ! 😩
@SpotifyCares All set! Thank you
@SpotifyCares When I’m clicking log in, it doesn’t respond, and if I close the app and re open it after a while. It’ll freeze on this screen. I even deleted and re downloaded the app https://t.co/ddlT7K6WIy
@SpotifyCares Swip down does nothing no symbol as show in guide. 8.4.26.770 armV7. Andriod 7.0 Note 5
@SpotifyCares Still nothing...
@SpotifyCares sorry still nothing...
@SpotifyCares Like I am playing the Global Top 50 Album here. In most services you have repeat all, repeat song, repeat off. With Spotify only "Enable repeat one" is available and that too doesn't work as the song isn't put in a loop even after enabling it. https://t.co/NBoh6YSxCC
@SpotifyCares What about Albums the same happens in a Album as well?
@SpotifyCares What is the desktop app?
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much! You guys are the best!
@SpotifyCares Cheers.
@SpotifyCares yeah I remember that from when I asked about having more of my Dad's music on Spotify as well. I get that there's licensing issues and such,  just wondering if it'd eventually be possibleis all.
@SpotifyCares So can you contact JYP so he can put Got7 on Spotify and Source Music to put Gfriend's album LOL on Spotify?
@SpotifyCares Yes ! ima write my letter to the santa
@SpotifyCares Did that 2 years ago
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/Do9LebwX9R according to this community post there is a solution and that is to change the web player settings. However those settings arent present in any windows based browser I have used so far and I dont think I should have to use an UA exploit to fix this,
@SpotifyCares Why was it removed though? Its a pretty good feature that quite a few people like. I know replying to these tweets isnt helping me or making your shift any better but its a bit frustrating with the pace of development of something I am actively paying out of my pocket.
@SpotifyCares I'm following the steps you sent me. I'll let you know if it works. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares 3 days and so far no issues with Spotiamb. Scary that someone hacked me. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Please help me fix. I don't know what this is. Ruining Spotify for me.

@SpotifyCares Plus that community link states to only offer it to active duty personnel not veterans ... #jussayin
@SpotifyCares Ok! Is there in France Spotify prepaid cards valid for 1 year?
@SpotifyCares I see. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares my receipt for premium shows my username as u271gtp954nh4foh02cjawo2z and I can log in with that as my username. When I try to log in with lbux_ as my username it doesn't work. Is that how it is supposed to work?
@SpotifyCares Aii aii. We'll be waiting. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
@SpotifyCares It was used by someone else and I don’t know how to get it off theirs and onto mine
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares my whole discover tab has been influenced by music i uhhhhhh definitely do not like or listen to under any circumstance. only get recommendations from one genre that i would prefer spotify to ignore.
@SpotifyCares It's been like this for the past 8 minutes https://t.co/4LHAj32BSf
@SpotifyCares Sorry it took so long to get back haha :-) , but no, using another browser results in the same thing
@SpotifyCares It said "please wait" sorry* 😂
@SpotifyCares So I lose all my music then. Nice
@SpotifyCares All I want is to https://t.co/Oy89LlATv7 in HiFi
@SpotifyCares Thanks. It would be a great deal if spotify come up with lossless quality. If so, let me know 😉
@SpotifyCares Nothing actually happened. I just always accidentally click the "download" button when I go to my songs and then can't listen without wifi
@SpotifyCares That worked! Thank you
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/Y8bc8lmy07
@SpotifyCares Update your app. Jesus. Just update it. That’s all I need. Please.
@SpotifyCares Thank you♥️
@SpotifyCares Yep. Logging out and back in worked. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Actually, for some reason, it’s just on my phone. On my laptop, it works fine.
@SpotifyCares So will i get a 30 day trial with the student discount offer?
@SpotifyCares Thanks a lot for the response!
@SpotifyCares Any eta yet? :)
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/3qDpBR9AIm
@SpotifyCares Did that years ago. Still waiting :(.. You're gonna miss the market here, Apple music, tidal, and play music have come..but they aren't u
@SpotifyCares Alright, thank you!
@SpotifyCares Yeah no problem
Song title- This Girl
Artist- Laza Morgan
@SpotifyCares I've been trying to sign in and upgrade, I couldn't see any reason yall wouldn't want my money..
@SpotifyCares And it says that email was not associated w a login. Please help, I have play lists saved I would hate to lose
@SpotifyCares Already disconnected all apps/changed Facebook pswrd still no response
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares It’s shite, hence my tweet, intelligent/smart shuffle could be another fuction implemented to premium.
@SpotifyCares Yes @SpotifyCares followed me but @115888 sphasnt followed me yet??
@SpotifyCares Can I dm you ?
@SpotifyCares Very clear. Thanks for the quick response time and the info :)
@SpotifyCares Good to know. Does that mean subscribers can make fresh downloads for offline listening, and stream music when abroad for extended periods of time &gt; 14 days ? In other words, are there any limitations for subscribers at all when abroad  &gt; 14 days ? Thanks 🙏.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares That’s how it looks now. I can’t find any daily mix’s https://t.co/vOIhDLMFP6
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I already have. Just wondered if there's any progress, as it was requested more than 5 years ago!!
@SpotifyCares I love Spotify, but not having an option to filter out explicit songs, and play a "radio friendly" version instead, stops me from using it due to having a 2 year old who picks up on everything that's said. Considering the original request for this feature was opened 5 years ago..
@SpotifyCares Thanks, but that doesn't help the fact that I like to listen to your recommendations / weekly playlists, yet they always include explicit versions of songs
@SpotifyCares Thanks. DM sent.
@SpotifyCares @115888 Spotify 1.0.66.478.g1296534d on MacOS 10.11.6. Client does not seem to be robust when things get tricky e.g. network changes, captive portals, poor connection or switching audio devices. It regularly gets confused and throws this error.
@SpotifyCares Oh come on... Does my description sound like I need that kind of help? This is not a one-off issue. Been happening for months through restarts, logins, etc. Client is buggy. https://t.co/cp7YlnpXCD
@SpotifyCares Where do I turn off my 2 other devices so I can have all 10,000 on my phone?
@SpotifyCares Is this a common issue? I've noticed that there have been a few people on the feed complaining of this
@SpotifyCares Just saw this. But it's been about a year and i think a lot of people are still waiting for this. The app also don't feel as optimized as the iOS version
@SpotifyCares I’m now locked out of it despite already cancelling the family subscription and reinstating the one I actually use. Was in the middle of getting everything back &amp; now can’t access it
@SpotifyCares The contact forms don’t have a category for being hacked. I have sent an email to support via Paypal and have deleted the people from it, changed my Facebook password and cancelled the subscription.
@SpotifyCares Appreciate the response https://t.co/zSTsvf2EBK
@SpotifyCares I️ understand the why, just wish it was there. You guys are the best. Thanks for reaching out.
@SpotifyCares Dude, the link you provided also error... #doubleFail https://t.co/CZtPGWrfdz
@SpotifyCares Have you check if the link is work before ask me to check mine. I tried on PCs and mobiles, both provided the same result.
@SpotifyCares Dude! I got a new problem. I cannot make a payment. It keeps alert me this error for 2 days already. https://t.co/57xJJqnecF
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares iOS is 10.3.3 &amp; Spotify version is 8.4.25.906

@SpotifyCares Just reinstalled. It's still happening
@SpotifyCares Launch @115888 in India.
@SpotifyCares Hi, here you go. https://t.co/iFM0lOHmxi
I think it shows as a another artist but she's just one person. Thanks for looking into this.
@SpotifyCares Thank you. Actually, I just love @34221 and can't let this pass! Ahahahaha

@SpotifyCares Tried rebooting as well as logging out and back in, still no difference.
@SpotifyCares I just tried, following the directions exactly. It made no difference, I still have a ~10 seconds delay. 😞
@SpotifyCares Thanks. It would be really cool to be able to do this with others' playlists (or Spotify-created ones) to make them your own. #Remix
@SpotifyCares Android 8.0. Spotify 8.4.26.770. I can stream music on my Sonos with no issue, but podcasts are a no-go.
@SpotifyCares No difference ☹️
@SpotifyCares Just did this-no dice.
@SpotifyCares @147836 OK in future I will use that, but I assume from your reply that this comment is being passed forward to the team? Many thanks.
@SpotifyCares will do !! 🎉
@SpotifyCares thank you xo
@SpotifyCares Error 404. Can't sign into my account. Please help.
@SpotifyCares Thank you &lt;3 !
@SpotifyCares Thank you. I know ad free versions of the podcasts exist because they say in the podcast that you can get them via subscription on Patreon. Just a bit frustrating pay for ad free spotify, getting ads in podcasts and they being told to subscribe for ad free.
@SpotifyCares Help for what? It works great. I just saw the announcement about trying premium for free.
@SpotifyCares "Can't play the current song", then plays after a few seconds, but randomly stutters.
@SpotifyCares I'm in Madrid
@SpotifyCares Nope! No VPN
@SpotifyCares Looks like account country is set to Serbia. I'll see if I can change it right now
@SpotifyCares Changed it and it works now. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Ugh! https://t.co/CsotceBUjk
@SpotifyCares Oh no! I like my 80s algorithm. That wasn’t a complaint!!
@SpotifyCares Yay I'm part of the 1% 

I'm worried as time goes on I will need more accounts!!
@SpotifyCares thank you
@SpotifyCares Where ?
@SpotifyCares Ya y siguen con lo mismo.

@SpotifyCares Is there anyway I can delete the hacker's activity on my android spotify app? I've tried hiding it but it keeps coming back...
@SpotifyCares Thx
@SpotifyCares Already on it... https://t.co/o7O5Wr4nW8
@SpotifyCares Link doesn’t really explain as @115888 already has content from Morrissey and RCA
@SpotifyCares nevermind it fixed itself
@SpotifyCares i downloded it yesterday so the latestr one i guess
@SpotifyCares I am on MacOS 10.13. Spotify is 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares just want to make sure I send you the right info. you want the startup shot from my taskmanager? or where would i find the info?
@SpotifyCares yeah, I select No. The I enter my library. if I go back to settings it is saved. but when I quit and restart the desktop app, it reverts to yes.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares I get a "This song is not available" error on the macOS app.

No error message on iOS app.

BTW, it works fine from the Sonos app.
@SpotifyCares This is a stage show about the band, not actually them performing
@SpotifyCares Done my friends https://t.co/BOfVycjNhS
@SpotifyCares A few months of premium thrown in, and I’d find a lot more 😎
@SpotifyCares The easteregg being finding compatible playlists? Nice
@SpotifyCares I just tried that it works now. Thanks 😂😂

@SpotifyCares how can you not, Looks logic to me to invest building an app up to date so that all users can use the app.
@SpotifyCares Hi, thanks for getting back so fast! I think it’s sorted itself! The message has gone and I can do more than shuffle! Thank you anyway! :)
@SpotifyCares I have no idea but I think more
@SpotifyCares Hi! I messaged you. Kindly check it. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks, but hurry up! 😊
@SpotifyCares Not at the moment! Just saying hello 😊
@SpotifyCares I can control it from the toolbar but not the lockscreen (see pic) https://t.co/9iybmSCXjw
@SpotifyCares Sucks as course I'm on isn't at a university grade only college
@SpotifyCares Decided to humor you by attempting this, but it obviously didn't work... maybe the algorithm just knows much I love "New Music Friday?" https://t.co/KaL0CnmALS
@SpotifyCares I know that, my point was that it used to be half year new music and half older songs that it thought I’d like, now it’s all new, every week
@SpotifyCares I listen to new and old music and the playlist used to throw up a real mix of old and new but now it’s nearly all new, I’m not convinced my listening habits are to blame. Are you sure the power of record labels and pluggers isn’t a more likely reason?
@SpotifyCares I get that it’s a great showcase for new music and labels want their tracks on it, however, it would be great to still keep the mix of old, or give us another discover playlist for older/classic (not brand new) tracks. Happy with either option
@SpotifyCares No. I never use private session. Kind of noticed a few months back.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I used that feature daily to set up what I'm going to listen to as I work.
@SpotifyCares That worked! Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Computer is MacBook/sierra, iPhone iOS 10.3.3 this problem has been around since before the new iOS came out, its gotten so that if I have a bunch of songs queued up from my computer I don't listen to my phone on my commute because I don't wanna mess it up :(
@SpotifyCares i just think ‘daily’ gives the impression it changes every day - this would be a big improvement imo
@SpotifyCares is there no way to change the order of the songs though?
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I was speaking in regards to the actual concert event! I would be open to help make that happen for the city. We need I️t.
@SpotifyCares @639498 Is @115888 and @SpotifyCares really that unaware that people want to see Spotify optimized on the flagship Apple phone?  I'd hope everyone from developers, designers, and PMs aren't that out of touch.  If so there's a huge breakdown in your process...like astronomically huge.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s, Spotify version 8.4.25
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply. It was popping up with "Can't play this track" blue box on every song for a while, but now it seems to have stopped. I'm on a PC running Win 7.
@SpotifyCares Thank you, but it's not allowing me to submit my inquiry on either my phone or computer, is there another way?
@SpotifyCares Tried my son's phone w/ Sony headphones. Worked like a charm!
@SpotifyCares Wear-watch (Fossil Q), Plantronics Fit and M90, Sony SBH60. None of them work. Can't really say when it started. At least a month ago.
@SpotifyCares Tried reinstalling. No luck. Play/pause still doesn't work. Next/previous works though.

@SpotifyCares Yess! I think it’s __email__ or Kira Dekker :) it’s linked to my facebook account

@SpotifyCares Being back sharing within Spotify! I️ cant stand the new social sharing only functions
@SpotifyCares This is a garbage response...
@SpotifyCares I don’t want to even see the lyrics option. It’s a dumb “feature”. Always gets in the way when I swipe down to change songs
@SpotifyCares lol I know but he's long dead. Just a joke! Love y'all
@SpotifyCares I'll be sure to check often to see if you guys launch in Namibia👌
@SpotifyCares Hi there, thanks for the suggestions. I did those steps, but a few days later the background data usage is up to 37.05 MB. What can I do to stop this from increasing? Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Voted. Crossing my fingers that I can count on spotify for my podcasting needs
@SpotifyCares I'm on a Google Pixel. It's a pain creating a playlist to listen to songs you're trying to learn to play and the service burns through your skips trying to get back to the playlist from crappy recommendations.
@SpotifyCares I’m thinking an X compatible version of Spotify should have been ready to go at launch, but hey, what are ya gonna do. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Thanks for the reply and thanks for relating the request!
@SpotifyCares sony xperia z5 compact, running latest android, spotify runninf most recent update (play store says 8.4.26.770)
@SpotifyCares That's a lot of space to save that kind of info. Please optimize. Neither the app is fast. I have terrible amount of time waiting to load a list of artists. It doesn't makes sense.
@SpotifyCares Thanks

@SpotifyCares Sweet! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares My top 3 are Toxic, Slave 4 U and Gimme More. Best album cut non single is Breathe On Me by a country mile. And Glory deserved to be a worldwide number one album.
@SpotifyCares What’s your favourite britney song?
@SpotifyCares Thanks babes x
@SpotifyCares La cuenta es de mi sobrina, que en un primer momento la hizo por una promoción del banco Galicia que era gratis por 6 meses, y después hizo una cuenta Premium. Me fijo en el recibo de la cuenta y aparece una nada más, pero me cobran dos. Gracias por contestar.
@SpotifyCares I would like to access my full profile (playlists, recently played, etc) from my roku instead of having to look up individual artists to play anything.
@SpotifyCares Lol you just sent me a link to a bunch of people complaining about the same thing and you still aren’t fixing the problem. 😑
@SpotifyCares ....in the app bro?

@SpotifyCares It sorted itself out after showing the same ad 4 times
@SpotifyCares Once it just played the ad and went (not playing a 60 minuite advert) but today it played the ad then 60 minuites of nothingness
@SpotifyCares I keep getting 63 min adverts every now and again for some reason and have to restart spotify
@SpotifyCares That only helps get rid of the advert being stuck playing
@SpotifyCares Thanks for caring. Spotify is still better than all them other apps.

@SpotifyCares It may have something to do with Airdrop but I’m not sure. I definitely didn’t give this random HTC Desire permission to use my account

@SpotifyCares Hi. Spotify app on Windows Phone looks like its playing a song. But doesn't. Requires phone restart almost always.
@SpotifyCares No worries no harm done ✅ xx
@SpotifyCares It’s podcast! 😳 https://t.co/1baJzptb2z
@SpotifyCares It only lasted about 20secs, I’ve just added my fiancée on the friends and it popped up, it said something like “get f@cked by Emma” or “guys we f@cked”? It wasn’t a rude pic just rude words
@SpotifyCares Hey.
I've tried what you suggested and still the same thing is happening. It just doesn't want to go trough with transaction and I use my PayPal very often.
@SpotifyCares Tried it and still the same with PayPal. When I try to do it manually it's declined because my credit card is not from country supported by spotify.
@SpotifyCares Same as every time I tried over my phone and laptop. After I click ''Agree &amp; continue'' it's loading and page goes blank.
@SpotifyCares I am running into HTTP Error 500 after logging in through Facebook. Would this be more of a Facebook issue?
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares i want my money back! I was just trying to update my payment, but it kept saying that there was a problem, and I would retype my payment and press it, and now it charged me 5x and said don’t worry we haven’t charged your card? That is my issues w my bank???
@SpotifyCares Yeah, I already saw that article. Thanks, though.
@SpotifyCares Awesome!
@SpotifyCares I far prefer that look to the standard view, I️m on iOS if that helps the team out cheers!
@SpotifyCares The chat team...for about an hour. For no resolution.
@SpotifyCares I've already done that and been told to contact some one else to claim my refund. It's ridic!

@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply! I just voted! Hopefully it will happen!
@SpotifyCares @646246 Please Spotify on Nintendo Switch!
@SpotifyCares @646246 voted! will remain hopeful!!
@SpotifyCares @646246 Voted. Would love to see Spotify on #NintendoSwitch
@SpotifyCares @646246 Nothing happens when I press the vote button.
@SpotifyCares Huh, it worked in Incognito mode. Caching problem, I guess.
@SpotifyCares @646246 In Europe too?, or only in usa
@SpotifyCares @646246 I want to have Spotify on my nintendo switch :D
@SpotifyCares @646246 +2000 votes on an idea that is a no brainer? Why isn't the official line on this "Yes, we're working on it!" instead? This is seriously confusing. Obviously people want it. Duh.
@SpotifyCares No error message. It just will not play. But I can put on another playlist (made by friends or Spotify) and it plays perfectly
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s Plus. app version : 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares Did not work
@SpotifyCares I think it is working now! Thanks! If not fully resolved I’ll dm y’all.
@SpotifyCares I have a Samsung Galaxy S8+,
Spotify version 8.4.26.770,
Android version 7.0,
Samsung experience version 8.1

This also happened periodically with my Samsung Galaxy S6 S6 Edge+ as well before
@SpotifyCares I haven't tried to restart my phone because during those times, as I need it. It usually happens when I'm using my headphones and not on Wi-Fi
@SpotifyCares It happens in both situations, but it happens maybe like every few weeks, like once every 2 to 4 weeks sometimes
@SpotifyCares @633721 Hey Omar and Spotify, I have an Iphone 7 plus and I’m finding this is happening with all of my music systems not just spotify. Especially when receiving @124423 notifications
@SpotifyCares I use the most recent of both of them. I don’t think it’s spotify because it happened with Soundcloud as well
@SpotifyCares No and neither does redownloading the app or restarting my phone
@SpotifyCares No it doesn't, I know it's probably my phone because there's other problems happening too. Just have to save for a new one. Thanks for your help though

@SpotifyCares Hi! I’m using the spotify desktop app (ver. 10.66.478) on my macbook pro (OS high sierra). I tried the DNS fix (from the spotify community forum) and it worked for a while but now the error message is back.

@SpotifyCares @16134 How do we become a playlist curator?
@SpotifyCares Oh man, you don’t have any offices in Ohio and I’m a student studying network administration. Working at Spotify would be my dream job!
@SpotifyCares Awesome, thank you.
@SpotifyCares Hi there. I have an iPhone SE and it appears to be iOS version 11.0.3
@SpotifyCares 8.4.25.906 is the Spotify version. Yeah: happening on both. Something ‘changed’ earlier today, so it now shows my playlists, bands etc but still no search option and now no playlists
@SpotifyCares Didn’t even have to- issue resolved: menu bar now available! Thanks again.
@SpotifyCares This is an Ad, has nothing to do with the version of Spotify Im using :)
@SpotifyCares This thread goes back to years ago and seemingly it is still an issue other users keep mentioning. Can I really assume my additional comment will make a difference?
@SpotifyCares Also gone from the mobile app as well.
@SpotifyCares No, only Discover Weekly is there now.
@SpotifyCares it stops entirely when I open Skype to write, but not when I am getting a call there. will try to restarts at the end of the day.
@SpotifyCares Hi, after a Windows 10 update, the sound goes off when I move away from the tab where I've opened Spotify. which is annoying because I listen to music while working. :)
@SpotifyCares Paying but not having a service is less cool! The lack of telephone support is ridiculous! Info. Sec. is a serious business and you've allowed my personal data to be hacked! #gpdr
@SpotifyCares Yup, my home WiFi
@SpotifyCares Desktop is running Windows 10. Mobile Spotify is 8.4.25 and desktop Spotify is 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3. I think they are all the recent updated versions because no updates are available
@SpotifyCares UK. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the quick reply @SpotifyCares! I have spoken to @121122 about this too and it seems the issue was their end and has been fixed. I’m back to fantastic @116130 premium!!  Have a great weekend
@SpotifyCares Have you changed the way search listings work? I've noticed a few similar situations. Happy to elaborate in a DM.
@SpotifyCares thank you!🌸

@SpotifyCares I’m using IOS 11.1.1 and spotify version was the photo attached. The reputation album of taylor swift only contains ..ready for it and look what you made me do. https://t.co/IF5dSzUc2w
@SpotifyCares This will do. But I just want to know how come it’s showing so many tracks for two songs?
@SpotifyCares Alright. That’s a big help. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares That was my 4:30 am angry tweet lol thank you 😊
@SpotifyCares Hi im just wondering if when are you going to upload the Reputation album?
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.2, Spotify version 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares No, I have to close the app each time I finish talking on a call in order for Spotify to give me the option to play/pause the music again. Otherwise it says it’s playing and the time goes on with no music playing and won’t let me pause it
@SpotifyCares This doesn’t do anything. Just tried to replicate the fault on my girlfriends iPhone 5s and it works as it should. Has anyone at Spotify tried this on an 

iPhone X? Play music&gt;accept a call&gt;end call&gt;music should resume playing and allow you to pause it
@SpotifyCares Oh no! All's good. Turns out i can only download songs up to 3 devices? So I guess that's my 4th device... Sorry for that. :)
@SpotifyCares @648198 Will it be coming soon?
@SpotifyCares Yeah the starred playlist. There have been times where I’ve noticed I’ve accidentally swiped a song off, but this was more than usual
@SpotifyCares I had to download the app again.
@SpotifyCares This is the article I read about it https://t.co/nni0SYIlF2
@SpotifyCares Is she willing or not to drop it there? ;_ ;
@SpotifyCares when will it be ready though? it’s been on Apple Music for AGES
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I appreciate your response! Excited for it!
@SpotifyCares You guys are the real OGs
@SpotifyCares Bet.
@SpotifyCares Plus im on mobile, i dont see this star thing at all, just follow/unfollow
@SpotifyCares Oh, thanks a lot, the options were disabled because I was playing the songs to my Sonos speaker, thanks again
@SpotifyCares I added my email on there a year back already 😅 But thanks, anyway. 👍
@SpotifyCares ty
@SpotifyCares Sorry I meant more if I have music in my collection that’s not in yours. I know a few other services let you add it to the cloud to stream.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/O7WnsUOTa6

Falling Up has been defunct since 2016 and they are also not Russian.
@SpotifyCares That means you have no special deals... Right?
@SpotifyCares Hi
Just noticed the three month offer at .99EUR.. Would be nice to have a second account...
So I guess, the best thing to do, is group this new account with an existing one in a family package AFTER the three months... right ?
@SpotifyCares Spotify, you said that i can enjoy 3 month premium with RM2 then why it is not like what u said? https://t.co/UrztT3CPUN
@SpotifyCares Can you show me a step to get spotify premium with RM2 using molpoints?
@SpotifyCares Thank you! I have attached screenshots of my current operating system and Soptify version. Please let me know! https://t.co/WMtUDnb8T6
@SpotifyCares that didnt work. i also deleted the app and reinstalled after restarting and the issue still occurs.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/i5NYc7oCBi
@SpotifyCares I tried it just now and it still wont let me play music after playing a video or taking a call.
@SpotifyCares Lol too late I've bought it. Cancelling my premium subscription to pay for it 😋
@SpotifyCares It's just like a Firewall, monitoring all traffic going to and from the device. This was traffic leaving my phone on your servers.
@SpotifyCares Anything further you can do?
@SpotifyCares Not that I know of
@SpotifyCares Presume so but haven't downloaded a playlist recently and not since reinstalling
@SpotifyCares Oh sorry! Just wanted to know why the new Taylor Swift album isn't on Spotify?
@SpotifyCares I understand! Do you know when it will be available for you?
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s + version 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.2 + there’s no specific messages or anything; the music just stops completely
@SpotifyCares MacOs high Sierra. Its pretty much done this since the beginning of time. Spotify 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
@SpotifyCares Working a million times better thank you so much!
@SpotifyCares Now, I still can't access Hulu via my Spotify subscription. Help?
@SpotifyCares So you’re not prepared for such a large update in hardware from your user base AND you don’t have any info at all on said update. Do you know anything? Do you know why other/larger &amp; smaller businesses were able to accommodate and you STILL can’t?
@SpotifyCares No. no crashes
@SpotifyCares Thanks for responding! I have an iPhone 8 Plus with iOS 11.1.1. The Spotify version I am running is 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares No crashes, just started playing this 82 minute long radio show in the middle of my playlist! Restarting the app fixed it but this particular ad may actually be a full show that for some reason is running as an ad.
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares and i know there 2 accounts because i saw the other one and it had a picture of me and the other had no picture. One of them i was able to get a Hulu account but the other, i couldn’t because it wasn’t a student account
@SpotifyCares I️ actually need help with both of it. I️ was charge twice. One for $10 and another for $5 so I️ think I️ have 2 accounts, one with a picture and another with just a username.
@SpotifyCares i actually got one of the people from your  team to fix it. Jerry S. on the live chat was such a help! Thanks for the help anyways!
@SpotifyCares Idea? It’s a logical app optimization.
@SpotifyCares Win10, the version the installer downloaded from https://t.co/IKXh39wu9f downloads and "installs"
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6S, iOS11.1 and 8.4.25.906! It shuffles between the first 4 albums on the playlist, and if I start it from another song further down it’ll only shuffle the 4/5 albums around the song I’ve chosen :(
@SpotifyCares This didn’t work :( and I just updated it as well and it’s still the same songs being shuffled next to each other
@SpotifyCares No luck it still shows an empty playlist!!
@SpotifyCares Version 7
@SpotifyCares It's for my son so let me get his info
@SpotifyCares not at the moment. I’ll try later on. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares hi. It’s still happening. What can i do ?
@SpotifyCares it says the song is playing but i can’t hear anything. I have to force close it and reopen it for it to work.
@SpotifyCares It is excluded available album?
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares I think all iPhone X users would like to see that. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Hey, thanks for the tip! Incognito window + VPN worked! Now happily listening to @88224's Autumn Songs playlist!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for answering. I'm in Israel, but I have a VPN with apparent endpoint USA. Doesn't seem to matter; I can't get in no matter what I try.
@SpotifyCares The "my queue" option is no longer available in my pc, nor in my mac, just on my iPhone. Please see pic https://t.co/pAfHaSnjky
@SpotifyCares Certainly I am
@SpotifyCares Done. It works beautifully. Gracias!! 🎶
@SpotifyCares Oh I don't blame you, I blame the others. I'm forever loyal to you guys.
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares MBP 15“ Mid 2017, OS 10.13.1 and it‘s spotify version 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares No worries. Sure, I’ll give it a shot after work. Need to debug something now! Thx for your help!
@SpotifyCares No, still the same.
@SpotifyCares Okay, fine. But why assume I’d want to use these codes in the first place, rather than, say, tell them what the song is with human words?
@SpotifyCares Days later and every time I get that notification I’m still more and more annoyed - it’s so ABSURD to tell me about these codes so so often!
@SpotifyCares Hi, I'm playing from iPhone 7 iOS 11.0.2 and I have the last version of the Spotify App (8.4.22)
@SpotifyCares If presale is sold out would that be the problem?
@SpotifyCares I’d strongly prefer to not not sift through 10,000 songs. I’d rather just delete and start over. I only care about what’s DLed to my phone.
@SpotifyCares Great!
@SpotifyCares Fixed it. I remotely un-linked my Spotify Account from the PSN account on my Desktop. This enabled the app to pop up the log in page.
@SpotifyCares How can I do this if I can't log into any Spotify account from the PSN account? I open up the app and it doesnt give me any option to log in. It just gives me that error message. However, I do get the prompt to sign into a Spotify account on a different PSN account.
@SpotifyCares Nope :(
@SpotifyCares I'll look out for a tweet in future then. 👍
@SpotifyCares OK, but can you follow up with what they say?
@SpotifyCares I have version 8.4.26.793 and the search bar only appears when I swipe from the bottom but you cannot click on it because you are swiping up. It won’t appear any other way
@SpotifyCares so i got hulu to cancel my account through roku. but i need help on how to merge my spotify and hulu accounts now
@SpotifyCares You really outdid your self this time spotify. Thanks babe.
@SpotifyCares Of course. Just press the feather and type in “@129288 S/O the greatest feminist ayeee yuh” and press tweet. You can throw in a gif of like a dog or something too. Love you bbg
@SpotifyCares can you just shout me out please thanks
@SpotifyCares I updated to the latest version and it worked. thank you
@SpotifyCares It has always been like this. It seems like it just preferences certain artists.
@SpotifyCares Newest version of everything for iPhone
@SpotifyCares It only shuffles through a small selection of my toys library.
@SpotifyCares Aight so it's a @19279 problem then?
@SpotifyCares You just need to create a rap playlist that has songs with more than 30 different words. All of them are mainstream garbage and it's difficult to find new music in hip hop and rap that isn't some force fed brainless mainstream trash to be honest.
@SpotifyCares Okay can we talk in dms
@SpotifyCares yeah been doing that and its one of the top voted features... you guys clearly dont know how to treat your paying customers. apple music has been treating me well this past month, probably going to keep it at this point. already imported all my playlists.
@SpotifyCares “SpotifyCares” lol
@SpotifyCares But just do the watch app k thx
@SpotifyCares thank u!!!
@SpotifyCares I will never worry @SpotifyCares ;) Come on guys, code was available to you way before release. Is it so difficult to keep up with the latest technology? Looking into this or preparing a new release?
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares You the best.
@SpotifyCares I just want lyrics. Pls. Help me.
@SpotifyCares The 13-track album Desde Lanzarote (2017) belongs to Spanish-language band Los Campesinos, but it is currently lumped in with the British Los Campesinos!, whose most recent album is the 11-track Sick Scenes (2017).
@SpotifyCares Here ya go, mates. Cheers.
https://t.co/oq9bwNLHmu
@SpotifyCares Yes, the update was successful.
@SpotifyCares I used the Inspect element in Chrome to look at the code for the form.  It loaded in the window pane on the left side.  When I closed the inspection tool, the form was still there.  I entered my information and all is well.  Weird.
@SpotifyCares Windows 7 Professional OS, Chrome, Explorer, and Firefox all had the same result.  No error message, the browser just goes to the update page and sits there waiting for the form to load.  I attached a screenshot... https://t.co/iGlgxMubg1
@SpotifyCares A shame! This is basic info and a must have... upvoted of course...
@SpotifyCares I haven't received anything yet
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much.
@SpotifyCares sure,  how may members we can add on the family account?
@SpotifyCares thanks a lot 💜
@SpotifyCares What name am I supposed to give other people then so they can find me?
@SpotifyCares Great to hear! Saw this mock-up, something like this would be awesome! https://t.co/eSSrBAMz8u
@SpotifyCares it’s working now after i deleted the app and then reinstalled it ☺️ thank you
@SpotifyCares Yeah the playlists stayed downloaded, and I’ve re downloaded some of my albums, cheers
@SpotifyCares The ones I downloaded, this is the second time this week and third time this month, kinda annoying ngl, plz help
@SpotifyCares @155914 Same here, I'm thinking about moving to Deezer/Qobuz for HIFI sound. Unless Spotify moves in this direction too !
@SpotifyCares same problem. music still plays when i unplug headphones.  listening to music, switched to play a video in twitter, switched back to spotify, music is still “playing” but no sound.  checked volume and that i’m listening on this phone, have to force quit app https://t.co/zMAedsVJYK
@SpotifyCares iphone x, ios 11.2, spotify 8.4.26
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I sure will!
@SpotifyCares Here’s some video so you can hear both tracks. https://t.co/nvzdxl4X7u
@SpotifyCares I'll try that and let you know.
@SpotifyCares Just rebooted my computer and logged out/logged in to spotify. No change!
@SpotifyCares I've reached out several times already over the past 6 months. No response or resolution. Any advice?
@SpotifyCares Thnx! Cant signup. A JavaScript won’t load. Tried chrome, incognito mode and edge. Any ideas?
@SpotifyCares @655593 Email is __email__ thanks!
@SpotifyCares @655593 Can you please respond to my DM? I want to know how you got my new card info without my consent. Thank you
@SpotifyCares Can I dm you guys lol
@SpotifyCares How are you going to give me a link that don’t work
@SpotifyCares i’m asking when!!!!!!
@SpotifyCares When will it be available?
@SpotifyCares Well this is bull. What am I paying 10.99 for a month if I can't get access to new music ?!
@SpotifyCares Sorted. Thanks
@SpotifyCares 1.0.67.582

This popping/crackling has been happening for about 2 weeks. I'm a premium member so I also have high quality on
@SpotifyCares No messages, just the bad crackling and popping, tried downloading and streaming, also cleared cache
@SpotifyCares I'm on a Windows PC, tried absolutely everything hardware related and also tried reinstalling and turning off hardware acceleration
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares thank you for your help 👍🏻
@SpotifyCares Thank you @SpotifyCares but will I be notified before it starts charging me after the 30day trial?
@SpotifyCares Yeah I tried that too. The playlist shows up on my computer but it won't show up on my phone. On my phone it looks like there are no songs there but on my computer they are.
@SpotifyCares Yes I tried that and it is not working. Also I can't find the local files folder on my iPhone.
@SpotifyCares I generally only use my iPad to listen to Spotify. Just checked my iPhone, and the list for one of my Daily Mixes seems to be different than the iPad.
But since I almost exclusively only listen on one device it would be nice if the lists there were always shuffled daily.
@SpotifyCares That’s the thing, though. Each individual mix doesn’t seem to shuffle; the first several songs are the same &amp; in the same order on multiple days. Do the lists not have enough data to give an actual daily update?
@SpotifyCares please advise
@SpotifyCares Cheers buddy.  I just hope spotify sees the light and allows an option to remove it.  Ta.
@SpotifyCares Ah bugger.  Its a shame.  I tried to listen to some Prince and got 1 of his songs but I had to losten to 4 suggested tracks.
@SpotifyCares Had issues since iOS 11, currently running 11.1.1 with Spotify version 8.4.26.793. The bottom menu comes and goes randomly. 

Doesn’t always do it
@SpotifyCares I hope so because I use Spotify everyday and have enlisted others to use it too. Not sure how much more of a fan I can get.
@SpotifyCares Now iPhone X, 7 Plus before.
No audio from Spotify after playback was paused by Siri to read iMessage. All other CarPlay apps work fine with this (Apple Music, Pocketcasts, Tunein, Mixcloud, …)
@SpotifyCares It doesn't clear anything as Think With Your Heart by @257872 has no explicit lyrics so that tag should be removed.
@SpotifyCares Yes or no ?
@SpotifyCares You're amazing for responding! Thank you. I bought it instead xx
@SpotifyCares Hmmm thanks I'll troubleshoot and let you know. :)
@SpotifyCares Oh, that's sad to hear, looks like I have to deal with a long number rather than having my username I have everywhere on social media for now :/ But I guess I got that number as username because I signed up using Facebook login years ago.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! It worked after 20 min
@SpotifyCares I don’t like that I can’t play my playlists in order, I have to shuffle play them
@SpotifyCares okkkkk I know that, but when will the entire album be available to stream?
@SpotifyCares I opened the app and it had logged itself out so I logged back in and the only saved songs were the 1s I had when I used it free Also I checked the subscription and it said free and Ive checked 5 mins ago and now it says premium trail but you have taken the money this for month!
@SpotifyCares Awesome. Can’t wait.
@SpotifyCares iOS 11 with latest Spotify update.
@SpotifyCares That's unacceptable on every level. Today is the release date. I know it isn't your fault. She's a snake for this.
@SpotifyCares Yup. Already doing that. Thanks for the help.
@SpotifyCares I'm talking about the Spotify+Hulu package
@SpotifyCares WELL I️ DONT WANT THE SINGLES. I️ WANT THE ALBUM
@SpotifyCares I’m considering reissuing my Apple Music subscription
@SpotifyCares Taylor is just trying to spill the good tea and you guys aren’t allowing me to listen
@SpotifyCares I uploaded my album on Spotify through cd baby. But my album was uploaded to another artist by the name of "Jeteye" instead of me "Jet Eye" can you have my album "The Take Off" removed from his profile and uploaded under mine.
@SpotifyCares I keep getting automated replies with no help to my question
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately it does not... I’ve rebooted the phone, reinstalled the app and nothing. However, I’ve tried on a iPhone 5S with iOS 11.1 and the latest version of Spotify and it works...
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6S. Thanks 👍🏼
@SpotifyCares The fact that you would use the word family but the people MUST live in the house is really insulting. If it has to be people who live with youi call it what it is, household, or house, or address. But it's not family. You've basically said my family is not my family.
@SpotifyCares Well there are multiple locations across the us not to mention mmi which is also a part of it.
@SpotifyCares Any update to DM?
@SpotifyCares too lazy thanks though
@SpotifyCares Ok I don’t know what I did but it’s working now. It was saying that the music wasn’t available.
@SpotifyCares Windows 10 and I have the newest version. I uninstalled Spotify and reinstalled it.
@SpotifyCares Awesome! Thank you!!!
@SpotifyCares Here you go! https://t.co/Iak4RfUX6P
@SpotifyCares Closing it in app switching mode in iOS and re-opening brought it back. I just wanted to report it as a possible bug 🤓
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the reply!
@SpotifyCares Through trial and error, I was able to get my Son signed in. Have to tell you that Spotify’s invite to family plan process sucks, and is very unintuitive. Spotify’s help pages are of no help either. I have to repeat same process for wife and daughter and not happy.
@SpotifyCares oh cool-- thanks LOL I legit didn't know how I could suggest it officially
@SpotifyCares Perfect. Done. Now go vote for my idea everyone: https://t.co/alCdc1SR6X
@SpotifyCares Thank you, but Hulu's customer service was able to take care of it, hours ago. But I appreciate you getting back to me. Have a good evening.
@SpotifyCares Done and done, thanks!
@SpotifyCares The D-Tent boys, truly a group of lyrical geniuses well ahead of their time wouldn’t you agree?
@SpotifyCares Thank you! 😁
@SpotifyCares I uninstalled the app and when I installed it a month later that is when I noticed the change . could be zoomed in some how ?
@SpotifyCares The version I like is 8.4.25.771arm v7 which is on my tablet iOS 6.0
@SpotifyCares When will it be available??
@SpotifyCares Wtf is this app running in the background?
@SpotifyCares Ill try that
@SpotifyCares Wow that worked. Thx
@SpotifyCares Thank you 😊
@SpotifyCares Happens everywhere. Even when I open the app and don't have data signal.
@SpotifyCares I have a new Moto G5 but I had the same problem with my old phone. Even when offline. https://t.co/GeaHIJOVPw
@SpotifyCares 👍
@SpotifyCares Is this a new thing? Does it apply to playlists as well as saved albums? It seems a bit arbitrary tbh.
@SpotifyCares Turns out it was a change in macOS High Sierra: https://t.co/MuybiDiGzQ A bad change, but a change nonetheless.
@SpotifyCares Yep, stops working on iTunes too. Not sure what Apple are trying to accomplish there.
@SpotifyCares Thanks :))) https://t.co/AgVIYypZUI
@SpotifyCares sounds good!
@SpotifyCares English is fine! I have spotify premium but i would like that student discount, how do I change that?
@SpotifyCares Thanks but you don't get the point! You have to remove and reinstall the app to go online as there's no way to log in again, serious design flaw.
@SpotifyCares Yea that’s exactly what I ended up doing !! :$
@SpotifyCares No, It seems to be working fine today , it must have been a glitch in the IOS or something ! Thanks for the reply :)
@SpotifyCares The billboard in Times Square on the Marriott. New music Friday billboard. I am voted in the game in Sway &amp; featured in Hot New Hip Hop.
@SpotifyCares Ok will try that out!
@SpotifyCares Amazingly, it has now come back to life 👍 sorry to have bothered you.
@SpotifyCares Yep, over 4g and wifi. I've tried that, it works fine with my laptop. Could it just be the mobile app glitching?
@SpotifyCares I am on my samsung galaxy note 4 and i am on the mobile app. I try to sign in and it says "we are currently experiencing problems, please try again later." I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice now.
@SpotifyCares please let me change my user i am haunted by my sixth grade self Every Single Day
@SpotifyCares Sure! May I DM you?
@SpotifyCares Haaaaaaaalp
@SpotifyCares Great. I think you’re gonna look great and it was one of the apps, I was really looking forward to on the X!
@SpotifyCares PLEASE HELP ASAP THIS IS A SECURITY MATTER
@SpotifyCares @70012 deserves her own Spotify page get on I️t thanks
@SpotifyCares Ok so I left my feedback this seems like a pretty big thing I hope it gets fixed soon https://t.co/be7m2Jhav5
@SpotifyCares Seems to have gone away overnight, it was on IOS 11.1.1
@SpotifyCares @661837 Hey @118266, please help @SpotifyCares on Twitter 😀
@SpotifyCares Why you not ask @118266 what's happening exactly? /RYO
@SpotifyCares Hey , yes the problem is when for example I listen to music and somebody call me , after finishing finishing my call, the Spotify doesn’t work anymore. The music is playing but 0 sound I have to completely close it and re open it! Im on IOS 11.2.
@SpotifyCares Actually I just got a update to IOS 11.2 public beta 2 and the problem is gone !! But anyways thank you very much for you help 🙏🙏🙏 excellent support 👌💪
@SpotifyCares How sooon😣😣 a swiftie can't wait any longer😭😭😭😭😭😭
@SpotifyCares I sure will keep a 👀 out
‘@SpotifyCares :— I need to cancel my subscription to Spotify immediately.  You make it so difficult to contact you.  No more payments.  No remember signing up for premium and don’t want it period.  No more contact from Spotify.
@SpotifyCares Done - how many votes (on average) does it take to have the PM/dev team actually listen to it's customers?
@SpotifyCares No worries! Turns out it was on my end and i didnt realize they sent the email to a different account. Thanks so much you guys are the shit!
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares I eventually got it to play, but I'll DM you the details of the issue
@SpotifyCares Sure it’s an iPhone 6s on iOS 11.1.1 and version 8.4.26.793 I’m on a Premium Account as well
@SpotifyCares I’ve done that. Still having the same issues.
@SpotifyCares I have saved like 2 albums offline each like 14 songs or less because I don't really save them for offline
@SpotifyCares Last time i did that was a week ago and it reverted back to 6gb
I'll try it again and see if it changes
@SpotifyCares Ok thank you
@SpotifyCares A Samsung galaxy s7 edge, don't know operating system, and newest version I guess
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks just wanted that album but Thanks Ill wait until y'all get it for Spotify! Thanks again!
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Dell and Lenovo PCs, Win7 and 10, chrome
@SpotifyCares Not sure, but I have similar issues on my home wifi.
@SpotifyCares Sorry, that's frustration more than anything. But yes. I listen mostly on my iOS device, and frequently notice patterns like that when shuffling. I am not kidding when I say shuffle played an ENTIRE album almost in a row last night
@SpotifyCares Yes, have over 500 songs on one and there’s no easy way to get from top to bottom.
@SpotifyCares ?????
@SpotifyCares It would be awesome if you could since we use it for parties through the TV. #PartyMode
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your reply
@SpotifyCares Awh Cheers!!!
@SpotifyCares @115888 take note.
@SpotifyCares Thank you very much💜
@SpotifyCares The remix noo, the original @115888 of @276220 💜🇪🇸
@SpotifyCares Thanks a bunch. 👍👍👍👍
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/iqvwikCiKp
@SpotifyCares still the same ):
@SpotifyCares can i change the order of my playlist when i have local files on it?
@SpotifyCares I make beats. Producer
@SpotifyCares Hope I can be
@SpotifyCares Hi Have u got Boot Polishan on spotify plsssss
@SpotifyCares Do you know which song we need to have on spotify?
@SpotifyCares the music keeps pausing for no reason. i closed all my other apps and i have no notifications yet it continues to pause.
@SpotifyCares It does NOT work. Cant add any of my family! Wtf? https://t.co/qPXxNnfhZT
@SpotifyCares @115888 why does a bunch of stuff tell me it's not available even though i tested on my friends acct and can listen there? @664280 username
@SpotifyCares It is an album from another artist in the same page. Look for 'The Band' and the latest release is from somebody else ;)
@SpotifyCares You need to build a bot with better reading comprehension.
@SpotifyCares Tks. It is on an iPad. Can I advise in the morning when I get to work whar the other info is? Trying to have a day off today.
@SpotifyCares Okay, thank you so much for the answer. I'll be waiting for it. Thanks again.
@SpotifyCares Will do, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Just saying Spotify++ is stealing peoples info
@SpotifyCares Sent you a DM
@SpotifyCares Google Pixel. Android 8.0. Spotify V 8.4.26.770 armV7
@SpotifyCares Strange. Never listen to music like this. Either way: why is it that I select “shuffle play” for a specific album, but get random out-of-genre music rather than what I asked for?
@SpotifyCares This wasn’t a “playlist,” I tried to listen to a specific album..
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Got it resolved with online support 👍🏽
@SpotifyCares problem is that's like having no drake for latinos, on a saturday night at that!
@SpotifyCares i use windows 10. no worry it's working now!
@SpotifyCares Can't wait!
@SpotifyCares It’s and iPhone 7 with ios 11.0.3 and the Spotify version is 8.4.26.793 and it’s not just me this happening to, it’s happening to my friends 2
@SpotifyCares I’ve done all of the above and nothing changes it
@SpotifyCares Yes I have done that and I just did it again, it’s not my phone nor is it any other phone that this happening 2. It’s something wrong with Spotify itself. Listen to the version online or on Apple Music then go to Spotify’s you’ll hear the difference.
@SpotifyCares That’s what I thought, just never experienced that before.
@SpotifyCares Awesome 👏 thank you for the prompt reply!
@SpotifyCares I don’t have premium, I’m using the free subscription one and I usually use my iPad for Spotify but it’s synced to my phone as well (iPhone)
@SpotifyCares You have Uyama Hiroto on Spotify! Please pull some strings to get Nujabes too.
@SpotifyCares i didn’t ask for anything t swift related but pls try to fix the why dont we song
@SpotifyCares thank u sm u guys r great
@SpotifyCares @664913 @147836 That's a must have on road trips!

Seriously, you can build amazing things, but you won't add this basic and neccesary feature? Looks like @115888 and @SpotifyCares don't really care 🤷🏽‍♂️
@SpotifyCares Hello! I’m on iOS 11.1 and here’s my Spotify version. I also keep getting a message that says I’m using a web player (chrome) when I’m not? And songs from this random playlist auto play even after I’ve stopped them https://t.co/nrT7mK7qL9
@SpotifyCares What does the feature do?
@SpotifyCares Spotify 8.4.27, iOS 11.3 beta, iphone 6s
@SpotifyCares Spotify app only. Didn’t have this issue before. And before everytime i plugged the phone to the car, it starts playing. Now i need to disconnect and connect number of times for the app to work properly
@SpotifyCares iPhone 4s v 9.3.5

It's less noticeable on my iPod 
But still pretty close to the edge https://t.co/3dxCxdM8ZZ
@SpotifyCares 8.4.26.793 on both devices. 
That's a bit weird, exact same versions on two devices one says your music the outher Says your library
@SpotifyCares OK thanks
@SpotifyCares to be clear, i need to be able to have a spotify acct that is totally private. would like to keep playlists, etc., but if this is not possible will delete my spotify.
@SpotifyCares :)
@SpotifyCares An iPod Touch.
@SpotifyCares thank
@SpotifyCares i'm trying to listen to a classic bop, new perspective by panic at the disco, but yall r finessing me
@SpotifyCares Outsource it or something then
My people need music
Better managed and legal
Hurry up please
@SpotifyCares Sadly, Free.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares !! Thanks !!
@SpotifyCares MacBook Pro, OS X Yosemite 10.10.5, idk if this is the Spotify version but 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares Restarting wifi and computer does nothing
@SpotifyCares I only use it on this device.
@SpotifyCares And thank you ^_^
@SpotifyCares Play button doesnt work. Macbook pro 13, OSX Yosemite, Firefox 56 (64-bit).
@SpotifyCares Hi! I think you guys made a mistake related to an artist, please answer me asap!
@SpotifyCares Give me access to the code and I can help to speed things up, I am a iOS dev 😁👊🏽
@SpotifyCares I have an iPhone 7 newest iOS
@SpotifyCares I can’t log off with No menu will reboot the phone now
@SpotifyCares Thanks so much I thought what a strange update is this, no menu.....😂
@SpotifyCares Galaxy S7 Edge, latest os, and latest spotify version. error message being "could not share to twitter. please try again."
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/Wsgl15KGFG
@SpotifyCares Not to get snippy or anything, but this has happened before and y'all still haven't fixed the problem.
@SpotifyCares Sent!
@SpotifyCares I already have heard them.. I want to listen to the album
@SpotifyCares I hope so
@SpotifyCares There’s been lots of posts like this one, around for awhile. Spotify doesn’t take its customer suggestions seriously unless they are minor suggestions.
@SpotifyCares iPhone, IOS 11.1.1, Spotify version 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares Nope just crashes goes back to home screen
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares You are so believable after telling me this for over a year and a half
@SpotifyCares I've been sending you info since March of 2016. You should have enough by now.
@SpotifyCares I'm tired of giving you info with no improvement whatsoever
@SpotifyCares Turns out they are, they got back to me! It was the middle of the night when I discovered it, got prompt communication this morning.
@SpotifyCares ily
@SpotifyCares I did that, i deleted the app twice and still happening.
@SpotifyCares Working now thanks
@SpotifyCares In my library
@SpotifyCares yup!
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares i mean thankss
@SpotifyCares i'm on macOS Sierra, 10.12.6 and latest version of the Spotify app
@SpotifyCares Yup, the issue persists
@SpotifyCares Yes, I did
@SpotifyCares Yup, put them in one playlist, here's what happens (it's not all of the songs, but a bunch of them) https://t.co/qD22nuwSTr
@SpotifyCares i did that
@SpotifyCares Iphone7+
@SpotifyCares Also those options aren't there https://t.co/qcXv5Blr09
@SpotifyCares I don't want recently played but recently added
@SpotifyCares Perfect!!
@SpotifyCares We got it figured out, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Support got to me llate last night. I have my account back 💚 Stay awesome, guys.
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks! I voted to please build an app for it! I may have to switch to Apple music otherwise so I can run with playlists
@SpotifyCares The link is asking me to sign in but I don’t have an account..Can I buy e-card without account? Also, can he only buy a 12 month subscription or can he get 3-6-12 mth subscriptions with e-card?
@SpotifyCares Hi, That’s the right song you’ve stated but clicking on the link doesn’t take me to that song, takes me to other gravediggaz songs. I’ve searched so many ways but can not locate it on your app. Your assistance is appreciated by the way.
@SpotifyCares No, I'm hoping you could add Aaliyah's last few albums. You currently only have her first.
@SpotifyCares My phone. iPhone. Pleaseeee fix it :/
@SpotifyCares Hey BH! I’m on an iPhone 8, iOS 11.0.3
@SpotifyCares “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” is missing 2 songs, “Revolution” is missing 4 songs, and “Four the Record” is missing 3 songs. Weird. Those albums probably need to be readded in full.
@SpotifyCares United States
@SpotifyCares Spain
@SpotifyCares Your UI is all jacked up @117168 and you need to fix this. Could potentially have billing issues if the name of the account owner differs from the one on my paymentt. It's ridiculous that there's no way to change the name in the account settings. This is a common problem too.
@SpotifyCares My ID is 24forall. I added my dad as a member and some days later premium cancelled. This happened twice for him. @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the prompt response! My phone seems to be recognised as multiple devices on the 'Manage Offline Devices' screen, which could be the source of the trouble.
@SpotifyCares @136221 (with an android phone)
@SpotifyCares i've sent an email. Thank you
@SpotifyCares its been 8 hours. My subsricption is not activated on my account. Please help, i lost my money. Double money. your help means a lot.
@SpotifyCares I've sent a DM abt my account's email address. Please, take a look. Thank you so much.
@SpotifyCares thank you so much!
@SpotifyCares what a pity :( I hope that we'll get it in future :(
@SpotifyCares okay, thanks
@SpotifyCares Start spotify, connect a Google Cast device (Chromecast/Google Home), start in the middle of a playlst.
once the some is done playing, it plays the first entry in the playlist.
@SpotifyCares the problem does not occur when I play a short playlist (my ~50 song playlists all work fine)
@SpotifyCares doesn't help. also trying it with my old phone results in the same
@SpotifyCares dude. i already tried that. does not help.
@SpotifyCares But you have G-Wagon and not So High woooowww
@SpotifyCares Alrighty then 🙂
@SpotifyCares Is there any way to fix this problem? I've restarted my app but it's still experiencing the same problem ☹️
@SpotifyCares Iphone 6, ios 10.2
@SpotifyCares It works!!! Thank you so much! You guys are so responsive ☺️💕
@SpotifyCares Hi it’s fine I rectified it 👍
@SpotifyCares I didn't expect an answer but thank you that's very nice of you
@SpotifyCares It's a bit strange where you can play 16 of the tracks; all by the same groups or similar, but not all. Perhaps you should've waited to get full agreements from all of the bands, before offering it up. It's an era I love, so I was disappointed. I hope it can be sorted out. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Thank you.
@SpotifyCares It’s ok thanks it’s righted itself now
@SpotifyCares Resolved very quickly via email, Thank you, Romeo!
@SpotifyCares No - i was playing on mobile and I’ve downloaded the songs. I was connected to spotty WiFi but the songs were still downloaded.
@SpotifyCares I have spotify premium and have down loaded all my songs but since switching phones i can't use it with out connecting to the internet.
@SpotifyCares I can't even get on spotify now. Seriously? What have you done?? #joke.
@SpotifyCares It’s sputtering and refuses to load immediately. Now I can’t even log in right away. Have to quit the app a few times. Having this trouble on PC and Mac.
@SpotifyCares If this can't be resolved, then very unfortunately I literally have no reason to continue using the Spotify service. Since I bought a new Android device, (another S7 Edge replacing my last one I lost) this issue has prevented me from enjoying Spotify.
@SpotifyCares several songs from album spotify:album:3f3kWND9tvmfI3UEsYH4yc including these: https://t.co/DCe6OzpXqj
@SpotifyCares I'm afraid that after nearly a year, this is still broken :( For example: https://t.co/uuSTad0Wek
@SpotifyCares I have solved it with customer support by email, thanks anyway :)
@SpotifyCares It's also when I open new apps it pauses the Spotify songs
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your help! I hope you guys can add them to Spotify soon!
@SpotifyCares I’m using my iPhone and it’s iOS 11 but its not only different for me it’s different for everybody on Spotify, the tune in he background is different from what it use to be and it’s still the same on iTunes and there music video
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/2Dv4AHE3yJ
@SpotifyCares @89669 It's good to be an engineer.
@SpotifyCares Hey thank you all for responding!
@SpotifyCares I know that ones not on you lmao we good
@SpotifyCares @115888 This is the absolute worst way a customer should have to reach out for support @SpotifyCares .
@SpotifyCares Yeah yeah... @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Yeah you have previously answered the same when I asked this 6 months ago. Please fix this. Please... @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares lmao sorry its taken care of i think its because i used to be a part of another family plan
@SpotifyCares It’s all set#Help #AtLast
@SpotifyCares Thanks https://t.co/3UO1otuQi6
@SpotifyCares Sound would fade in and out #Or passwords not recognized on every item #distortion
@SpotifyCares I tried all those prior to reaching out #FRustrated
@SpotifyCares It does. Cheers.
@SpotifyCares Pls fix it 💖💖💖
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/1UyQqiD3mz and https://t.co/YmCVKmAxrm
@SpotifyCares thank you
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares iPhone 8 Plus and the newest Spotify version!
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares no error messages, it just literally won’t even let me press the log in button or the sign up for a new account button either!
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares no I have tried that!
@SpotifyCares Windows computer
@SpotifyCares i actually dont! i use Spotify Web Player haha but it works just as well. i also use the spotify app on a samsung tablet
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/S6DONYsixy
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/ksTVQuBKO1
@SpotifyCares I have Spotify premium as part of my payment plan on my mobile network...I've recently bought a smart watch and downloaded Spotify onto it to use in the gym, but I don't know my login details...please help
@SpotifyCares This is disappointing to say the least
@SpotifyCares 11.0.3 os. Spotify 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares Nope 😞
@SpotifyCares Sorted now, cheers
@SpotifyCares Please DM me back
@SpotifyCares Screen saver on smart TV whilst listening to Spotify... it's a no brainer!
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares false alarm...email finally came through!
@SpotifyCares Thanks...I suggest you eliminate the Account page from app. It’s completely useless. Even with Premium: https://t.co/WAK6eIGaSL
@SpotifyCares @28762 He's also a verified Spotify user, what's going on?? he should be treated the same
@SpotifyCares Thank you x
@SpotifyCares It worked! Thank you! 😎👍
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares Thank you for responding, Spotify. Great customer service.
@SpotifyCares Hey! Thanks for the help! iOS 11.1.1 and Spotify version 8.4.26.793! It’s when I’m using headphones!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply. I knew that but was really just whining.   (:
@SpotifyCares Yes it does! Thank you very much!
@SpotifyCares Thanks ;)
@SpotifyCares my fingers are crossed, dude! Thanks
@SpotifyCares I already listen that playlist.. But i want the new album.. :/
@SpotifyCares It happened to all my songs in the albums I had saved, the songs that were in playlists stayed. I just redownloaded them but I was just confused
@SpotifyCares It's not the suggested tracks, it's the actual tracks in the Playlist. They all changed to songs I've never listened to. The suggested songs reflect what the Playlist is meant to be not the songs that were randomly added to the Playlist.
@SpotifyCares i can click thru the website and it responds, but nothing will play. the sidebar updates "recently played" but it's all lies!
@SpotifyCares Hi! Is "1.0.67.582.g19436fa3" a version number? If not, where do I find that?
@SpotifyCares I don't take the laptop off its charger every day so I'm sure it took me a while to even notice. I chalked it up to not using the battery much at first and dealt with it for a week or three before really trying to troubleshoot w/ different programs and all
@SpotifyCares Okay thanks!
@SpotifyCares Make it hAPPEN
@SpotifyCares Upvoted but that idea is 5 years old. Taking my business to your competitor, you lost it just because this missing feature.
@SpotifyCares "Recently" over a year ago. The people in those comments are complaining about the exact thing I am.
@SpotifyCares When I open up snap (prob their issue), like a tweet, open safari, things like that, Spotify will quit playing sound but continue the song and will only work again once manually restarting the app. Thanks for the fast reply!
@SpotifyCares Both, Spotify is 8.4.26 and running iOS 11.2, both brand new so bugs are probably expected
@SpotifyCares my bad for the late reply! but can confirm it did not work, I’ve since turned it off and on multiple times for this reason as well as other iOS bugs (ex: black camera, frozen apps, etc) (currently using iPhone 6S for what it’s worth)
@SpotifyCares Actually I resolved it last night, I used the desktop version and clicked "Restore Playlists" and they were all there. Not sure how they got deleted simultaneously tho...
@SpotifyCares Please present soon Nu'est song titled hello, until now this song is not yet present. thank you :)
@SpotifyCares Logging in to my new TouchTunes app and being able to connect that to Spotify.
@SpotifyCares I will try.
@SpotifyCares No it’s just that your app never loads when I try to launch it.
@SpotifyCares I believe that this did start happening after a recent update, because before this update Spotify on Xbox one was running perfectly fine.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply! It was the best feature!! ☺️
@SpotifyCares My iOS is 11.1.1 and logging out/ restarting does not work at all
@SpotifyCares Just to be clear, the playlist will still be there with all the songs, but I'll just have to re-download it to "offline"? 🙂
@SpotifyCares And it appears the account has been hacked again. Someone is using my account to listen to music on what appears to be their own devices. Please help!
@SpotifyCares Looks like it has been resolved after logging out/in, but any idea how a playlist got created by some random person? Have their whole listening history on my account too from the past few hours. Hoping we can figure out who/how this happened
@SpotifyCares Alright thank you
@SpotifyCares @118134 That website doesn't work :(
@SpotifyCares Account name: sjoerd.jobse34
@SpotifyCares 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares it doesn't seem like you really care.
@SpotifyCares Hey. All sorted. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares I’m on an iPhone 7, iOS 11 and fully updated Spotify app
@SpotifyCares Reinstall solved the issue, thanks!
@SpotifyCares This feature is too good to ignore as I have echos all over my house.  I'll have to cancel my account and start using amazon's music service instead
@SpotifyCares Hmm I don't think that this is the solution I am looking for. I'll give it a go....
@SpotifyCares thank you!!! :)
@SpotifyCares my daily mixes repeat songs. i listened to my daily mix 1 for an hour and heard multiple repeats :(
@SpotifyCares yes you guys changed the background music to Why Don’t We’s These Girls and i miss the og version please change it back
@SpotifyCares Well?? Are you replying or not?
@SpotifyCares sent a dm!
@SpotifyCares Ok, maybe I’m not hitting ❤️ or 🚫 enough.  Most mixes rock!  One is just getting too repetitive.
@SpotifyCares when I'm listening to a specific album I keep getting recommended tracks and can't listen to the actual album 😩
@SpotifyCares No worries, I found out how to do it.
@SpotifyCares Running on iPhone 8 plus, IOS and Mac 💻 high seirra
@SpotifyCares Sadly not just tried it there! So weird that some of my music is working but others don’t, add @34965 to the list
@SpotifyCares Both!!! At home and Work, my friend doesn’t appear to be having any issues
@SpotifyCares I already have 30 songs on this playlist... how many do y'all suggest I have so I can avoid 7 suggested tracks in a row?
@SpotifyCares @AskPlayStation the thing is that I don’t know what the psn for the account that has it sinked though...
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply! I think o have resolved it now, it didn't seem to like a password with numbers/punctuation in it?!
@SpotifyCares I cancelled my subscription just for the moment. I'll be back next monday!!
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Was slightly annoyed i had to open a twitter account just to contact spotify. Hence my frustration.
@SpotifyCares Ayyyy my boy
@SpotifyCares Tried to completely uninstall and reinstall multiple times over the past few months. Most current.
@SpotifyCares Why would I disable my bluetooth connection when I need that for phone connectivity? Why can't you add an extremely simple disable slider to a feature that should be optional, not mandatory?
@SpotifyCares ive already signed up, still waiting.
@SpotifyCares Sorry if I came of as rude at all.
@SpotifyCares 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares Yes it exibits the same behavior on a second PC running Windows 10 with two monitors @ 1080p. Mine is three @ 1440p.

Second computer's version is 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares I've already restarted numerous times today with it happening but I'll humor you!
@SpotifyCares Same result as before after Spotify logout→reboot→Spotify login→maximize→WIN+SHIFT+ARROW
@SpotifyCares No. Same thing. Same version was installed (1.0.67.582.g19436fa3)
@SpotifyCares I could send a clip but sending a screenshot would effectively be the same thing.

When the arrow key is pressed, the Spotify window changes position as expected, but is a still image. The music continues, but the timer freezes.
@SpotifyCares This bug is 100% reproducable but the mouse behavior can vary. In either case the UI stops updating and clicks  do not work (change track, like/dislike, clicking a playlist to change the view, etc)
@SpotifyCares Steps to reproduce:
1) Open Spotify in Windows on a multi-monitor computer
2) Ensure Spotify is maximized/full-screen
3) Play a song song (not necessary to trigger the bug, but you won't see a frozen timer otherwise)
4) Press WIN+SHIFT+RIGHT ARROW
5) Observe the Spotify window
@SpotifyCares Yeah I have done
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6, 8.4.26.793. Yes, it looks like it’s playing but no audio, if I pause it goes back to where it was before being interrupted.
@SpotifyCares A video of strange play/pause behaviour while there is no sound https://t.co/aHv4QDlazf
@SpotifyCares FYI- I think it’s an iOS issue. I logged it with the beta team and they’ve replied saying it may be fixed in the next release
(@SpotifyCares  what should he do)
@SpotifyCares 8.4.26.77O armV7 https://t.co/zhpEJWUImO
@SpotifyCares Still none :( https://t.co/PqzrhPe9f4
@SpotifyCares Hey PL and AY of SpotifyCares! Thank you so much for the help!! I used my mobile internet data instead of WiFi and they all showed up! I guess i need a WiFi upgrade 😂. Thanks again!!
@SpotifyCares Do I get a % of the cut if you guys use the idea ? 🤔 Lmao jkjk but like 4 real
@SpotifyCares Thanks, but no point. Last time, I spent all my energy going back &amp; forth on DM with no result. You just need to fix these issues!
@SpotifyCares Most recent version. It's not a matter of version or device, it's the way you treat the lists. For instance, the current queue can't be cleared, it's crazy. Sometimes after app reboot, it deletes itself losing everything.
@SpotifyCares Sweet! TY
@SpotifyCares Happens with every playable song
@SpotifyCares Newest Spotify version and macOS 10.12.6
@SpotifyCares Thank youuu!!!
@SpotifyCares Damn shame... that feels like a missed opportunity for a great #featurerequest !
@SpotifyCares Aces. Thanks a mill.
@SpotifyCares thanks guys. I was wondering why my Sportify process was running a lot higher than normal. Changed to a different soundtrack and was fine. Does it only do it for the official soundtrack? So if I create a playlist of the OST, it won't do it?
@SpotifyCares Thanks for getting back to me, seems to be working now... im on an Iphone working on 9.3.2 (so rather out dated, that may be the issue).
@SpotifyCares I am using IOS 10.2.1 and using Spotify 8.4.22.515
@SpotifyCares I just looked if it was gone and it is, so I didn't even have to restart my phone. Besides that, thank you!
@SpotifyCares @116130 @SpotifyCares As such I can't log in and access your support online to resolve this and twitter is the only way to get help now?? I'm worries they now have my contact details and card details too
@SpotifyCares No worries just felt stranded without only online support but kudos to you and your email / web chat teams too 👍🏾
@SpotifyCares Oh sure!
https://t.co/Ap4ApsgwaM
@SpotifyCares Thanks a lot!
@SpotifyCares Oh I listen to the singles daily don't you worry ;) Thanks for the reply, I'll keep checking for album.
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares Wonderful! Can’t wait for the update 🙌🏻
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the reply!
I will check it out right now!
@SpotifyCares You are not following! Your model is biased to think that if I like items in "coleteo venezolano"  then I will necessarily like items in "gaitas venezolanas". This bias is outrageous.
@SpotifyCares My college doesn’t provide a student email unfortunately so can’t have uni days😩 oh well will have to stick to free! Thank you
@SpotifyCares It still requires an institution email?🤔 https://t.co/hli0SGOzPZ
@SpotifyCares Nvm it's my cellphone Carrier
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares p l e a s e
@SpotifyCares help
@SpotifyCares Running Android 7.1.2 and Spotify 8.4.23.784 armV7
@SpotifyCares ITS OKAY THANK YOU I HAVE IT NOW 😭😭 @328645 https://t.co/I3Yaka8kzT
@SpotifyCares Idk what i was on. I think it was a playlist radio or something but it was pretty random 😂
@SpotifyCares on my Android phone and on the laptop MacBook. Both have exact same issue. https://t.co/Wyyz0ENvo0
@SpotifyCares happening with numerous albums not just this one, fyi https://t.co/2k2i8lmatz
@SpotifyCares no, didn't make a difference in my phone or the MacBook
@SpotifyCares listen here buddy. this isnt fingers crossed. im paying 9.99 a month to listen to my thugger so i better get it
@SpotifyCares it just came out all g, thanks for your help i guess
@SpotifyCares YES MAKE IT HAPPEN 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
@SpotifyCares never mind sorry
@SpotifyCares good lookin out 💯💯💯
@SpotifyCares plug!!
@SpotifyCares Thanks🙏🙏🙏🙏oh and am going back to my country in Africa will it still work?
@SpotifyCares The app yaani
@SpotifyCares Yes it is! Thanks 🙏🏻
@SpotifyCares Such a shitty service I will be getting Apple Music soon ✌️ only good thing is free Hulu but fuck that
@SpotifyCares God bless
@SpotifyCares yeah, thanks, any reason why it was late??
@SpotifyCares okay cool, thank you!
@SpotifyCares My songs have suddenly become not downloaded anymore. 2 days ago I updated the app but the songs were still ok. What's causing this?
@SpotifyCares I wanna can listen my downloaded songs out of your app is it possible?
@SpotifyCares Thank you, I'll give it a go.
@SpotifyCares Thank you guys :-)
@SpotifyCares Awesome. Thank you 😀
@SpotifyCares I don’t care about the layout, just being able to play music after being interrupted
@SpotifyCares It was on songs, artists and albums but they're back now and I didn't do anything. Glad they're back 😊
@SpotifyCares Got it haha thanks, spotify.
@SpotifyCares When I click to play a song it just skips through them all on the playlist. Like it wants to play but won’t
@SpotifyCares C’mon bb don’t be like this. Ya girl broke but she like her music
@SpotifyCares The problem is that i have to many good playlists i wanna be able to listen to any time, anywhere.. My gym is a bunker so i can't use 4G inthere, therefor it's handy if i can listen to them pre-loaded.
@SpotifyCares @spotifycares https://t.co/izevKdBJ0T
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+. iOS 11.1.2. Spotify 8.4.28.1104. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares It seems to be ok now.  I turned off large Text and turned it back on.   Note the reset procedure you specified is not correct for iPhone 7!   Regards.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Was hoping you might be helpful and confirm whether it is known/being addressed.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the troubleshooting help. Logged out, rebooted, logged in. Still happening. Safari, YouTube, or Apple Music audio works right. Just wanted to report and find out if you all already know and are working on it. :)
@SpotifyCares I’ve got a ton of saved offline content so I’m not eager to do that unless it’s really likely to fix things...
@SpotifyCares Thank you! :)
@SpotifyCares It's not working with an incognito window.
@SpotifyCares Thank you! Help save my work days!
@SpotifyCares I cannot change my password. Apparently he has gained total access to my account.
He has changed my email, Facebook access and password, so I cannot change anything. Can you do something for me?
@SpotifyCares ilysm thank u
@SpotifyCares @151631 Because now it sticks to the one song, no matter how often I play it all the way through. Spotify is now unusable, an instrument of torture.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 Plus and it’s the most updated version :)
@SpotifyCares Yeah! It’s still doing it but not as frequently
@SpotifyCares Whenever I receive a snap the music will just stop
@SpotifyCares So it worked great yesterday and now it’s doing it again like randomly 😭
@SpotifyCares When I am playing one of my playlists there are songs that will pop up “suggested” songs I think. If I skip I believe it’s counted in my skips as I have the free version. I am listening on an iPhone...
@SpotifyCares Please add more old songs . Thank you
@SpotifyCares Alright , but can you add equalizer to Spotify 😅
@SpotifyCares @678762 Paid and still don't have premium
@SpotifyCares Nvm thank you spoke to an agent on the chat you guys have thanks for the help guys!
@SpotifyCares Tried that. Also reinstalled. Seems to have gotten worse. 😕
@SpotifyCares Bisa tolong dibalikin ke premium ga ya min? Aku saya jadi free
@SpotifyCares Definitely wasn't spotify's issue—I was maxing out my CPU and memory usage and things started imploding. :-P
@SpotifyCares Seems like shuffling artist should be a pretty basic function. You should really think about creating a shuffle option for all artists...
@SpotifyCares It's been talked about within your community since early 2014 and nothing has been done.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Makes zero sense for a community based app.
@SpotifyCares The situation has been fixed.
@SpotifyCares It just keeps spinning the continue button but it doesn’t continue.
@SpotifyCares I tried using my safari and Mozilla Firefox and my mobile phone
@SpotifyCares I just tried and I’m having this same issue with chrome, after I enter my card it just spins after clicking continue button. I tried inputting another card maybe thinking it was my card but I’m having the same issue still.
@SpotifyCares It seems to be working now... That was odd. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Yes that is correct.
@SpotifyCares Yes, I️ can get you a pic. I️ have service now thought, so I️ am not having an issue at the moment.
@SpotifyCares Done thanks
@SpotifyCares I’m using a windows laptop - browsers are Chrome &amp; Mozilla. I’ve uninstalled, reinstalled, refreshed cache etc. Nothing works! Thanks
@SpotifyCares it's been 5
@SpotifyCares Mostly Snapchat notifications, but I have noticed that if my phone is locked, it won’t tamper with the music, and I’m running latest IOS on iPhone 6s+ with the latest version of Spotify
@SpotifyCares I deleted and reinstalled but that did not fix it
@SpotifyCares No such luck
@SpotifyCares No. Router has been reset. Speaker is connected via UTP with router, But it doesn’t seem to connect. White led is on, But No sound. When pushing on II button, led Goes flashing orange.
@SpotifyCares iPhone for myself, Android for the ladies in house.
@SpotifyCares Spotify version 8.4.26.793 . I’ve restarted my phone; No difference. Left speaker still not producing sound. No matter if it is controlled via iPhone or Android.
@SpotifyCares Hi, no not a specific update from router, spotify or whatever. the both speakers did not react anymore when I wanted to play. They are stereo paired. One is OK the other not. It makes noice [volume/ EQ tune] so it seems WiFi related. strange..
@SpotifyCares After the latest sonos sw update the issue has been resolved! Case can be closed. Thanks for the support! Highly appreciated 👍🏻
@SpotifyCares Yeah but my library consists of stuff I’ve downloaded
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares singapore
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Update: it’s now up on Spotify but there’s no content https://t.co/2cWliIITST
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6, iOS 11.1
@SpotifyCares "It looks like you are using your Facebook credentials to log in to Spotify. To change your Facebook password go to your settings page at https://t.co/ShFuLmC95N." is the msg I get but then it won't let my FB log in either.
@SpotifyCares “Low usage?” Sigh. Has more votes than all but one of the ideas you just implemented! Paying for an app and having a feature removed is sad.
@SpotifyCares Thanks I've managed to sort it but What a nightmare x
@SpotifyCares Thank you x
@SpotifyCares I'm using 8.4.26 on iOS 11. Not sure though as no menu is available in the app
@SpotifyCares That fixed it. Thanks.
Still strange
@SpotifyCares Just got it today, looks slick!
@SpotifyCares It’s asking me to re enter my bank details will it take out the £5 on top of the £9.99 it’s already taken for this month? Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much for responding. I’ll be patient and I look forward to it ultimately happening. You guys are the best.
@SpotifyCares My desktop has always stayed with the same artist on shuffle. This is a new issue for me.
@SpotifyCares Oh come on, what are you afraid of
@SpotifyCares Thanks boo. I love you guys still 🌷🌹🥀
@SpotifyCares Hopefully soon. Thanks so much 💕💕
@SpotifyCares It’s more I want to be able to save albums but not have every track of that album saved in my songs. In fact I might want none of the tracks in my songs, but still save the album.
@SpotifyCares Pass a P45 or whatever the equivalent is onto them and hire folks that can get a damn update out on time #raging
@SpotifyCares Ya, those 5 songs I really wanted to save from last week but can’t find now. Ha
@SpotifyCares I’m on OSX 10.10.5 and the latest version of Spotify but this has been going on for a few months. It takes 5+ minutes to fully load the program and it won’t work until finished. I’m not the only one with this issue, it’s well documented online.
@SpotifyCares its not available here, so when will it be? https://t.co/Bc1zzZhoky
@SpotifyCares free version (sliders work now)
@SpotifyCares Windows 10 on desktop
@SpotifyCares Somehow I got the app into a state where the bottom nav wasn’t loading. Closed and reopened and all is well. I’m extremely sleepy, sorry
@SpotifyCares Done! I've just uninstalled it so let me know when I can reinstall:)
@SpotifyCares Just got the update 😘
@SpotifyCares No that's answered it perfectly. Cheers🖒
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares um hello??
@SpotifyCares Is there a way to set it so that it automatically goes into offline mode when I'm just on 4G? Because I could do that before I updated the app - have you removed that feature?
@SpotifyCares I hope so too 😕 thanks guys
@SpotifyCares You have the license, you don't post the pods as soon as they're available, so I'm paying $9.99 a month to wait hours for a podcast I could listen to immediately and for free on 4 other platforms. Podcasts are the main reason I use Spotify, so I need to know if I'm wasting my $$.
@SpotifyCares Got it. Thank you for the quick reply!
@SpotifyCares I'll be counting the days until then !! Thank ya
@SpotifyCares my email address is __email__ I log in to Spotify using Facebook, which (cont) https://t.co/Jl7jALkvU0
@SpotifyCares Mobile app https://t.co/UcRzSZsl44
@SpotifyCares i hope so 😢
@SpotifyCares @92563 @125633 @116130 Thanks. Fortunately @126654 have the #Zombi2 main theme up already so I can enjoy @92563's genius there! 🎧🎼 https://t.co/B74jtp8CDg @111664 https://t.co/RQTS31T8iI
@SpotifyCares Yes, iPhone 7 &amp; iOS 11.1.1 I’ve seen it’s a known issue and one of the troubleshooting techniques was uninstalling and redownload but it didn’t work for long
@SpotifyCares Yes it worked for now! I’ll let you know if anything changes!
@SpotifyCares Thanks SC!
@SpotifyCares Appreciate it. Just trying to help you get the jump on next release.
@SpotifyCares Nevermind, I straight up went to Apple Music instead.. #ByeFelicia #sureDid
@SpotifyCares THANK YOU ITS FIXED
@SpotifyCares i got it. but agust d's mixtape is locked in my country, and RM has his own  channel on spotify now because his collab with wale
apparently i'll have to wait for the day when I will be able to listen my faves on spotify because it seems impossible now -_- 
thank u for answer
@SpotifyCares I have found the bug, What happens is when the playlist are downloading avast scans the files coming in and makes it cache in ram. Then you need to end task spotify and restart the software then its deleted the files stuck in ram. So its a communication error with other software
@SpotifyCares Hmmm ok
@SpotifyCares iPhone X app looks great! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares It's only on the album "classic soft rock".
I just downloaded a different version that worked. https://t.co/3WrZYh7Ims
@SpotifyCares thanks
@SpotifyCares This started when I updated to an iPhone 8 Plus. iOS 11.2 &amp; Spotify 8.4.26.793. If a song is playing &amp; I jump to a video or anything else w/ sound in a different app, I go back to Spotify to push play &amp; it says playing but no music resumes. Have to restart to get song going again
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately I’ve already tried that to no avail. I guess I’ll try again. Is this only happening to me??
@SpotifyCares @156645 No it has been intermittently happening to me as well.
@SpotifyCares ok :( thank u for the info!
@SpotifyCares I have an iPhone 6s on ios 11.0.2 and I am using Spotify version 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares my sisters phone is very broken so I can’t get a screen shot of hers, but this is mine and her downloaded page is above podcasts and below artists https://t.co/ncW0VAfi90
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/Xo8xYuExR9
@SpotifyCares united states !! and this is what it looks like for me right now https://t.co/YdqQ0RqdWY
@SpotifyCares What? Not your data, your music database. Are we on the same page? 100% Shuffle All
@SpotifyCares Thanks your email counterpart helped me out!
@SpotifyCares Thanks @115888 We’ll be waiting. 🇵🇪
@SpotifyCares Please do. I do not want this every time there's ads, I normally listen to music quite loudly and I do not want this randomly showing up with my family or anyone around really.
@SpotifyCares I still do see it when I go to “edit profile”
@SpotifyCares I do there isn’t an option. https://t.co/YFOja9GN0V
@SpotifyCares I’ll try that because, Spotify works in Bumble.
@SpotifyCares Strange. It’s working now. https://t.co/4Zqg7jY8uU
@SpotifyCares Wow !! It works..I just tried it.  Thank you so much.  I knew u could share individual songs but not full playlists!! 🤩🤩🤩
@SpotifyCares i'll appreciate if you'll create 'upbeat/calm' playlist. ☺️
@SpotifyCares Apparently I can't screenshot an app on @115786 so here are pics from my phone. These are the three tabs I see when searching. Hoping for an artist tab so I can shuffle all their music. https://t.co/YbucAALXHY
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares I sent it
@SpotifyCares Hi, xiaomi mi max 2, latest Spotify version to date  8.4.26.770 armV7
@SpotifyCares Well
It is not the same at all. But I get the point about votes. Thanks
@SpotifyCares It’s been like 10 days.. no info.
@SpotifyCares but I just hope it gets heard for real. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I mean, check out those tags. Lowkey embarrassing. https://t.co/Gsyra8Ta9f
@SpotifyCares Hey im using it on my Macbook, Sierra OS and version 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares OK I get it now, thanks for responding 🙌
@SpotifyCares I got it thanks. Followed your help section like most forward thinking people would do lol. Cheers 👍🏽
@SpotifyCares And for the record, issues with apps as a whole.  Not a Spotify specific thing when I say that 😁
@SpotifyCares While driving using Bluetooth, any text alert or Snapchat notification causes Spotify to pause and I have to manually play again.  Spotify version: 8.4.26 and iOS version: 11.1.1.  Ton of issues since switching to iOS 11 so thinking this may be a new symptom
@SpotifyCares I worked it out. I accidentally misspelled the name of the road. How can I change it ?
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/gS11KMbckp
@SpotifyCares Hi! My account is set in Italy!
@SpotifyCares Oh I see now that I can't reach the last.fm website either, so it's probably a time-out of their servers.
@SpotifyCares Btw, u still have some songs missing from @15790 's Take Me Home Album! Wanna say something about it?! @115888 @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Just try to get every song from their album back on @115888 that's enough! Thank You
@SpotifyCares But... Danny byrd!! 😭😭😭
@SpotifyCares You don't like Danny Byrd either?
@SpotifyCares I’m trying to upload the cover of my playlist so i upload some 1:1 image from my PC, i’m using Windows 10 and the newest version of Spotify, but the image always shown like it was rotate to the left, thank you.
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares It doesn’t work, i tried it twice.
@SpotifyCares It all the same when i tried to upload different images with the different size and ratio too, but i’m not trying to change it using different devices, and mobile device can’t upload playlist picture. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Yes. How can I use this offer to get premium (by transferring money)? I mean, there will be an option to put the code to pay it. https://t.co/ge3Y1BHft1
@SpotifyCares I need to put the code for paying that. I mean, like account number that i will transfer my money to.
@SpotifyCares Ah, so daily mix works but the songs that play aren’t the songs that show up in the list and they’re all greyed out 😕
@SpotifyCares Okay so it plays properly in incognito but it’s still greyed out 😕
@SpotifyCares Nvm it’s not working anymore in incognito
@SpotifyCares Them*
@SpotifyCares I am hoping.

I am hoping also, once they got verified, their previous songs which aren't playable will be available that time.

The case with this artist, some of their songs' aren't playable but their account was already verified. I missed those songs.

https://t.co/xm2MwjD1MG
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the info. Anyways I love listening to my fav artists on Spotify.
@SpotifyCares But I hope you could notify the said artists for the verification. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Nope. I am not the artist. But as a fan, I want their accounts to get verified but dunno how. I guess only their label will be able to do so. Thanks anyway.
@SpotifyCares Ok thank you
@SpotifyCares Meybe  Problem with  facebook??? 
Sometimes  showing a Facebook Error has occiored.please try later.

@SpotifyCares I try  Pc Connect  to Spotify meybe works.
3 /4G / Wifi via phone  if not works
@SpotifyCares It’s ok, i took care of it via chat.
@SpotifyCares @688879 It’s getting beyond a joke now. Your developers have had since June to get the app ready. Really is shameful.
@SpotifyCares Well, as a paying subscriber for seven years I’d at least like to know exactly why it isn’t updated yet?
@SpotifyCares Sorry - But I’m asking for some information so please put me in touch with someone who can answer it. Feel free to discuss via DM if you’re uncomfortable being open to your users in a public forum.
@SpotifyCares haha. I love the link to the track. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Are you saying responses are in no way automated or pre written out? They do seam very robotic and repetitive
@SpotifyCares Why is it not an option?
@SpotifyCares Thank you kindly. I'm sure it makes for a better UX overall and is at least valid to test. Just a simple option to a song's context menu of "Stop suggesting this artist" or similar would be aces.
@SpotifyCares But @115888 has a huge customer base in Pakistan, I don't why apps don't prioritize their launch here!!! -_-
@SpotifyCares I will for sure, thank you for hearing me out. Do raise this issue with the @115888  management!!!
@SpotifyCares I lost my visacard so .. i can’t pay this time for spotify. New card on his way!
@SpotifyCares Appreciated!
@SpotifyCares Spent time last night working on it and fixed it! All is well, thanks for responding! Love Spotify! Will use it more now that we have a Google Home.
@SpotifyCares And the article posted above I looked at prior to tweeting.
@SpotifyCares That's great :D That means no switching between apps at the christmas party, since a few tracks are not on spotify but the problem is solved
@SpotifyCares I dmed back hours ago and haven’t got a response...
@SpotifyCares Help if you replied to my messages
@SpotifyCares Guys, XCode iPhone X simulator it's available from september. C'mon! 😉
@SpotifyCares Thnx a lot! 😉 I’ve also signed up for the beta on TestFlight!
@SpotifyCares We have already tried to log in and it and to restart our devices! Not happy at all! Please fix asap
@SpotifyCares Hopefully soon. Thanks again 🙂🙂
@SpotifyCares Thanks for getting back to me. A staggering 9327 at the minute...
@SpotifyCares That worked! Thanks for your patience

why @SpotifyCares how do i change this
@SpotifyCares Hi, I’m using an iPhone 7 IOS 11.1.1 and Spotify version 8.4.27.895. Thanks
@SpotifyCares I work with one or two people. The kitchen is next door to the cafe. I just want to make sure i am not breaking any rules as we have just found out we cant play the radio.
@SpotifyCares Loving the extra space with the update for iPhone X
@SpotifyCares thanks
@SpotifyCares Yay!! Thanks Spotify!
@SpotifyCares It pisses me off seeing all of my downloads disappear. Used the app before I went to bed, tried to use it on my way to work and it had logged me out. Removed all my downloads so everything had to be re-downloaded. It has happened several times. And shuffle STILL DOES NOT SHUFFLE.
@SpotifyCares My artist name is : tradin' music compilation
@SpotifyCares no will try and do so. thanks
@SpotifyCares I just wanted to know if there’s an iPhone X update in the line?!
@SpotifyCares Thanks @SpotifyCares for solving this issue quickly and professionally!
@SpotifyCares :) ❤
@SpotifyCares Not quite. More classical music for work. But I guess I can just use this since I can't find the other one anymore - https://t.co/MBJ5OKzsg3
@SpotifyCares I tried that I even uninstalled the program and reinstalled it and everything still said a connecting it does it on WiFi and on cellular
@SpotifyCares Fingers crossed for sure. It's some pretty obscure content, honestly. You have most of the artists, but certain albums are missing. The Explorers score by Jerry Goldsmith, for example. Here's a full list. A lot is missing from the catalog https://t.co/MZO4SJCzw1
@SpotifyCares Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Hey! It's just the holiday party in NYC.. I know it's free but have no clue what day and where
@SpotifyCares I promise you i don’t listen to Lil Pump and Xxxtentacion
@SpotifyCares im using iOS 11 and im using the 8.4 version of spotify
@SpotifyCares i’m sorry about how mean i was.
@SpotifyCares On Twitter? yeah. A couple times.
@SpotifyCares Hi. iPhone 6. On BT or connected via USB. Phone defaults to Apple music even if Spotify app open. Okay if used via @118117. Spotify App is bang uptodate via app store. Once open okay. Paused for any reason (call or disconnected) back to default.
@SpotifyCares Give that a go. The cynical side of me says it’s Apple trying to push me in a certain direction, if you know what I mean...
@SpotifyCares The site was not letting my reset my password but I finally got it!
@SpotifyCares 6S, iOS 11, and no screens sorry! Was stuck on home view and now playing, could  only navigate back and forth since there was no nav bar at the bottom. Force close fixed it but isn't fun to do all the time!
@SpotifyCares 8.4.26.793 is the version. Never got a far as logging out (screen isn't accessible without the bottom nav), and restart wasn't required since force close worked
@SpotifyCares Sure thing! Here is a compilation of just SOME of the songs that are not available. https://t.co/RX731fuijb
@SpotifyCares Sounds good
@SpotifyCares you can’t make and update a playlist without videos? ooooook.
@SpotifyCares it’s all good!
@SpotifyCares Nba youngboy
@SpotifyCares I don't need a family package
@SpotifyCares Yeah the saved songs, on some artists half the songs have been deleted but some are still saved
@SpotifyCares Yeah all my playlists are the same, just the saved songs that have disappeared
@SpotifyCares Both saved from albums and individually
@SpotifyCares As long as you guys are trying that’s all I can ask for thanks for the reply!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8, iOS 11.1.1
Spotify version 8.4.27
@SpotifyCares Yep! Right after that
@SpotifyCares If I got the fan email last time, can I expect to receive it again? You can bet I'm one of his biggest fans 😉
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the quick reply guys, I have sent you my details via a DM
@SpotifyCares Give them a cookie instead! 😉 New update came today...
@SpotifyCares Please hurry! 😇
@SpotifyCares 🎉🎉🎉
@SpotifyCares That did help, but I didn’t change the size after this update so why did this happen now. I do have it larger since I need it to see.
@SpotifyCares But you are checking into this, right? I really need the font back to where it was for me to use my phone
@SpotifyCares America.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply!😁
@SpotifyCares He wasn’t but he is now. He still cannot add songs to the playlist
@SpotifyCares He did all that previously. Looks like the flow option did the trick. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares well, after closin apps form PC and phone, I'm able to turn it on again.... strange
@SpotifyCares I'm logged in and I'm using spotify connect (not cast). Yesterday I was able to turn on repeat1 from PC or phone, today it's impossible.
@SpotifyCares That's what I'm have been doing: trying to reinstall. It doesn't help! I suspect one of the latest windows updates could be the issue.
@SpotifyCares There is no any Spotify folders in the mentioned destinations.
@SpotifyCares I was waiting for it to upload. Apparently they said it is fixed.
@SpotifyCares I think as long as you have legitimate proof you're a student you should be able to get it,not just in the big colleges as currently.
@SpotifyCares Do you have an ETA?
@SpotifyCares Already emailed 2 days ago from __email__ Thx ✌️
@SpotifyCares Hi - I waited a day or so to try again this morning, the same issue is happening.
@SpotifyCares Downloaded last night. Went to listen on the plane and all gone
@SpotifyCares None what so ever. Currently using a samsung galaxy s7
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/JtuaQ3A7dg
@SpotifyCares Thanks man!!!
@SpotifyCares If you sort that I’ll finally be able to get rid of iTunes once and for all
@SpotifyCares No worries. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares so you don’t have a feature which will stop a 13+ year old account holder accessing/playing songs marked ‘explicit lyrics’?
@SpotifyCares Can finally use my spotify well! Thank you so much for your help! More power!! ❤
@SpotifyCares @695058 Can we already pay with paypal or ideal? We students don't all own a creditcard...
@SpotifyCares I tried to follow those steps, but they asked me to replace my credit card for a local one... I was on vacation!!
@SpotifyCares I can't edit my postal code on that page, only email, dob, phone number...
@SpotifyCares @676265 when will it be available?
@SpotifyCares Wow my Daily Mixes are packaged much better now!! Thank you :)
@SpotifyCares That's it? Nothing to be done? Basically saying the behavior is expected at this time? Brutal....
@SpotifyCares The problem is I never feel like any of the issues I’ve brought forward have had any kind of resolution.  have to put up with your choices
@SpotifyCares What more info do you need? The original tweet had it all.
@SpotifyCares Do you think it only affects me? That all other users get their correct location from your database but mine and mine alone is pulled from IP?
@SpotifyCares When will it be? A sister needs new Taylor to jam to
@SpotifyCares You realize your biggest competition literally make this hardware. The longer you take to update, the closer people get to switching to @115948
@SpotifyCares Did not work. Still having same issue.
@SpotifyCares Whenever I play audio from another source while Spotify is playing I have to restart Spotify to have it play sound again. 

When it gets interrupted it doesn’t recognize that as a trigger to pause anymore. It’s fine if I pause first, then use another source and hit play again.
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.2, iPhone X.
@SpotifyCares I tried to upgrade to premium but my student profile would not verify. It still billed me for $5.40 but I do not have any premium features.
@SpotifyCares I was able to change to take the other John Pemberton's profile picture off of my page and put on my own, but that was all I could not remove his song, or get rid of his stats about followers, I need spotify help I sent fresh messages but heard nothing from Spotify , Can you help
@SpotifyCares I owe you an apology. I received my invite to test the new beta that supports the iPhone X screen yesterday at 8:49am and didn't realize it when I wrote this.  We can be friends again...
@SpotifyCares the backing track sounds different, if you compare the song to the music video you can tell a difference https://t.co/KmBmy9rUHF
@SpotifyCares i think most of the listeners just want the original version back and don’t appreciate the fact it just changed without any warning from anyone
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares 🔥 🔥 🔥 
Can’t wait!
@SpotifyCares Thanks, that would be great! Love your music and would love to listen to the books in the car. Keep up the good work! 👍🏻
@SpotifyCares iMac, Mac OS High Sierra, Spotify 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares thanks! It worked for about 24 hours and upon another restart the searching or loading no longer works, but all other programs and apps are running just fine.
@SpotifyCares no it works fine on my MacBook Air and on iPhone
@SpotifyCares Oh yes! Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Will do!
@SpotifyCares Samsung 55” 4K series 8
@SpotifyCares Old remote has limited functionality...can’t move the Spotify cursor...
@SpotifyCares thanks PB I appreciate u
@SpotifyCares Personally assembled Windows 10 desktop. And it's always the latest version of Spotify, because it apparently has to reinstall itself Every. Single. Time. 
I don't understand why the updates can't happen under the hood just like Chrome
@SpotifyCares Sorry to keep bugging you about this. I know it will take a while to get figured out. And maybe it's not even worth figuring out. Perhaps most younger listeners don't care. It just feels weird to me. But thanks for the effort!
@SpotifyCares i want report something, again, https://t.co/LBX1wUYAn2 this song have the wrong artist singer linked, 
and this one is the right singer spotify:artist:3qNVuliS40BLgXGxhdBdqu 
THANK YOU, 👍🏻
@SpotifyCares I️ connected to a different network when I️ was in a different location and it still didn’t work
@SpotifyCares It’s working on my phone, just not on my computer https://t.co/WHV9MFJj7H
@SpotifyCares I'm just kidding (kinda) 😂 but you're doing a great job girl! Keep it up ❤️
@SpotifyCares YOURE THE BEST I️ LOVE YOU
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/jB6se17VzR here it is. My country is set to USA.
@SpotifyCares yes it plays on my Spotify app on my laptop just not on my mobile app
@SpotifyCares Yes the song plays now but now a HUGE chunk of my downloaded songs aren’t downloaded anymore
@SpotifyCares Dell laptop w/ Windows 7, and I'm assuming this is the version: 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
Logging in and out didn't help, and I've closed/reopened the program a few times as well.
@SpotifyCares Actually I think it's my company's network, they just sent out an email saying there's limited connectivity issues. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Just on my laptop. Web player and desktop
@SpotifyCares Not on phone
@SpotifyCares Thank you! 🙏🏽🙌🏽
@SpotifyCares This is the song that was acting up: spotify:track:6wgRiURLlS2DKvT1pkUfAd
@SpotifyCares help me i just wanna watch my showsssss
@SpotifyCares Sure, it’s the 6S with iOS 11.0.3. It just started happening with the most recent app update.
@SpotifyCares Done. I can’t really play anything right now but I’ll let you know when I try it again later. Thanks for the help!
@SpotifyCares Just used it for a bit and my phone didn’t seem to heat up this time around. Looks like all is well! Thanks again
@SpotifyCares There’s nothing to opt out from? https://t.co/SLE3pCxZhC
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.3. Spotify 8.4.24
@SpotifyCares Ok I’ll logout and in. Will let you know when I’m in the car next
@SpotifyCares Alright. Thank you so much.  🙏
@SpotifyCares Wow! Super fast reply. Thanks for the feedback. Will certainly do! Hope it launches here soon 🤞🏻
@SpotifyCares don’t gas me up man
@SpotifyCares yeah, you pushed bunch of updates but still no "touch preview" on iOS. i hate searching/discovering songs while on LTE. spotify is such a bandwidth monster.
@SpotifyCares Aw. Spotify does care! Thanks
@SpotifyCares guess I'll just need to be more careful then. Thanks for getting back to me so quick!
@SpotifyCares when should we be able to stream it?
@SpotifyCares this is america and i want it now!!!!
@SpotifyCares 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3 does that help? I only downloaded it Sunday.
@SpotifyCares I'll have to have a go tomorrow night
@SpotifyCares Thank you for replying so soon this has helped me.
@SpotifyCares thnx i luh u spoofy !
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/wYJzxRw8l6
@SpotifyCares I am an android:  Samsung Galaxy Sky Pro.  Idk where to find what version of Spotify?  All my apps are up to date.
@SpotifyCares Additionally, it could provide metric on discover weekly 'success' via song retention. e.g. how many of the 30 songs are users 'keeping' per month? Will vote, ty.
@SpotifyCares No I’ve tried.
@SpotifyCares About a week or more. &amp; both.
@SpotifyCares IOS 11.1 &amp; Spotify 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares Como mando pra vocês
@SpotifyCares Ainda continua free
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/U9HfIubtqh
@SpotifyCares It's an lg g5 that got the latest system update last week, and auto downloads app updates so that should be current as well.
@SpotifyCares this is a surprisingly helpful response. you earned my respect
@SpotifyCares waiting.....
@SpotifyCares Android.
@SpotifyCares I am aware. I meant individual songs. 
I'd like to be able to see a list of all songs created by an artist. I suppose discography is a misnomer in this case.
@SpotifyCares Definitely. I am able to do it when some competing services and most other Apps. 

Thanks!
@SpotifyCares i’m just trying to look out for evan dando
@SpotifyCares spotify please it’s been two weeks https://t.co/uHmqtutGOv
@SpotifyCares is there no deliverance for the lemonheads
@SpotifyCares is this right https://t.co/xOQEGoNN6M
@SpotifyCares Oh figured it out. That’s extra. Having to click edit on the top right instead of just clicking the song and removing It. Can we get that back?.. but yay we can reorder songs now... woo
@SpotifyCares This didn't help me not one bit. I can't even sign on to notice the playlists are gone. WTF?
@SpotifyCares Yeah yeah. It's nothing but an elitist world.
@SpotifyCares Thank you. I appreciate you forwarding my comments and frustrations.
@SpotifyCares My gratitudes, my dudes
@SpotifyCares "When you download to the additional device, the device with the earliest downloads will be automatically removed from the Offline devices list...."
Huh?? So your most cherished collection on your most used device??? #crazy
@SpotifyCares That's great, but I'm not looking to spend more. She will be paying for it now on. Why discriminate against high school kids? May need to cancel subscription because of this.
@SpotifyCares Fantastic, please do. Need my jazz groove so work isn't soul sucking as much. https://t.co/WRuumHFphH
@SpotifyCares How long does it usually take to hear back? Already missing my music
@SpotifyCares Newest version of Spotify! Attached is the picture of the name of playlist. I’m not sure why but I can’t listen to this playlist and skip tracks.. I assumed it was her playlist name. https://t.co/5sH2jdBQJX
@SpotifyCares Okay I just tried all of that, no change :/
@SpotifyCares Every other playlist works, just not that one. And thank you!
@SpotifyCares Yes my username is hiimerlo that’s two i’s
@SpotifyCares @701848 No I pay for your fucking services. Make a visualizer.
@SpotifyCares Actually, yes, restarting the device did help. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares @701852 Same problem here. On lumia 950. No insider. It's been happening for a long time.
@SpotifyCares After the phone updated (while I was Asleep), spotify app started working flawlessly. It's been ages since it worked like this.
@SpotifyCares It doesn't but thanks anyway for trying. Just send my request thru to HQ pls. It's a worthwhile update Bless ~S
@SpotifyCares Amazing. That's exactly it. Thank you RH
@SpotifyCares Please yes :"" because I don't want to download Dongwan's songs illegally 😖
@SpotifyCares thank u i’m sorry i said i would delete u i love you!!!
@SpotifyCares I was waiting for a follow-up, looks like you didn't finish this tweet.
@SpotifyCares That's a canned response. Limit the # of downloads if anything. Don't limit the library size.
@SpotifyCares Thank you, that's what I like to hear! Have a good night!
@SpotifyCares @700253 Thanks for the reply- but it doesn’t answer the question: Why is there a limit on Your Library? If we can keep making playlists, why the limit?
@SpotifyCares Awesome! Thank you! ❤️
@SpotifyCares Doesn’t seem like Spotify cares that much tbh
@SpotifyCares Hello there. Here is the link https://t.co/CRjXeTWpzS
Songs from Fiction and below are all wrong. For instance, Fiction is actually Fiction (Orchestra Ver) and Back To You is actually Fiction and so on.
@SpotifyCares Now when I try to create a new account with my facebook login, it says "Oops! Something went wrong, please try again or check out our help area" and I can't login with it either. So it's useless, even though it's a different email than the work acct? Plz.. help me I keep Premium.
@SpotifyCares It gives me "Error Code: 3" when I try to login with my facebook account. The spotify account I should still have everything I built over the last few years can't just be gone because I linked it to my new work spotify account (can't sign into fb there). Plz help me get it back!!
@SpotifyCares @AskPlayStation Got it all figured out! Thank you though!
@SpotifyCares Bring back the music previews please!!
@SpotifyCares Very disappointing, will be looking for a more user friendly option to stream music.
@SpotifyCares Appreciate it!
@SpotifyCares The updated version is out and it’s solid. 👌🏻
@SpotifyCares Wag mo akong hinahamon. Please lang.
@SpotifyCares Ok, please credit my account for everything you take from me until it is fixed.
@SpotifyCares Okay, wait. I was saying that iTunes/Apple Music is cutting off my songs and was wondering if people had ever experienced that on Spotify? (For research purposes)
@SpotifyCares Okee dokee. We are super not on the same page, but that's okay! You've been very helpful.
@SpotifyCares Thank you, KB. I will do that.
@SpotifyCares Done! Didn't know that site existed, but happy to see I'm not the only one wanting this. ;) Thanks - have a good day! 0/
@SpotifyCares Hey! Just wanted to put in a request for your API team: Any chance you expose "thumbs up/ down" via your AppleScript API? Preferably "Save to Library" as well, but I don't want to sound greedy. ;)
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.1.1/8.4.27.895   I deleted the app &amp; reinstalled, seems OK now. I’ll let ya know if anything goes wonky.
@SpotifyCares Nope it just stops! Usually when I open Snapchat or I get a Snapchat notification hasn’t happened with any other all
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 Plus iOS 11.1.1 Spotify 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares Can you bring it back? It was one of the best and most unique features of @115888 .
@SpotifyCares Thank you.  Would be great to have a way you can do it without logging out and wiping all downloaded stuff.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/Fm8EfEfMcz thank you
@SpotifyCares Is there any expected date..?
@SpotifyCares My account become free, from premium with spotify family. because i forgot to verify my address on my account. How i can re-verify my address on https://t.co/W2I8ZyKyTs?
@SpotifyCares over 5,000 total, but only about 3,700
downloaded
@SpotifyCares how about for me and only me, you allow 6,666 offline songs? ill put the little purple devil homie emoji in my profile as a shoutout to you guys
@SpotifyCares Spotify on iPhone SE. Spotify version 8.4.27
@SpotifyCares Thank you, I got it. I had to scroll up for it to appear. Maybe have it fixed under the Shuffle button?
@SpotifyCares Hi have you any contact with the support team of @123765?
@SpotifyCares Latest version, reinstalled today on iPhone 7
@SpotifyCares I just can’t seem to locate the search engine guys https://t.co/rUg5Uydqxp
@SpotifyCares Turn it off and turn it back on again!! That old chestnut bloody worked!! Thanks guys
@SpotifyCares No error messages. The playlist I choose is just highlighted and stays that way. It doesn't add the song https://t.co/3VLl3sW2Y7
@SpotifyCares Chromebook, I don't know which operating system
@SpotifyCares It doesn’t need to have a street number, but they we’re asking me to fill out everything even the street number.
@SpotifyCares I do attend an accredited college so why don’t I get this discount?
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares Hey! Im using the free version on iOS, so I'm fine with the ads&amp;limited skips, I love Spotify, just want2listen2my own artists 😂 iPhone 6, v. 8.4.27.895. Thanku!
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Looking forward to the update!
@SpotifyCares Well, it would have done if Spotify didn’t just delete all of my saved tracks. I guess that solves the problem of not having anything downloaded as half of the stuff isn’t there.
@SpotifyCares Right so, I’ve resaved and redownloaded everything. Hopefully it stay this time.
@SpotifyCares Thank you. Here is my argued (and respectful :/) position about this: https://t.co/7aXMWDI7oF
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response.  I'm a fitness instructor &amp; I've been using Spotify for 5+ years with a premium account.  It used to sync between devices seamlessly, not anymore.  I'm on iOS 11.1.1 and current on Spotify version.  Did machine learning change over the last year?
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares ok now I'm on premium but I got charged twice because I tried to subscribe again, not knowing I was supposed to wait for an email to complete the process. I need a refund
@SpotifyCares My account is set to USA, but i keep searching and i think is not an @115888 issue. This google search shows the track is not in the album it was supposed to be: https://t.co/yn4qfZw3oY
@SpotifyCares just did, thank you.
@SpotifyCares I get this screen but I’m not registered with Facebook https://t.co/4HISf7X0ed
@SpotifyCares What
@SpotifyCares Sure! It’s iOS 11.0.3 and Spotify version 8.4.25. When I connect to Bluetooth in my car, I can’t change the song from there either
@SpotifyCares I just would really like to delete rap genre from my playlist. It's hateful music and I'm over it. Wish you could help.
@SpotifyCares I'm about to show my support to something else
@SpotifyCares Wow thanks Spotify you da bomb dot com
5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
@SpotifyCares Yes, i do. And nothing :c
@SpotifyCares Mmm.. i play 2 or 3 songs. Then it begins to jump one after another until it stops. And it does not allow me to do anything. So i clouse and run again the program. But it's the same. Sorry my english it's so bad :/
@SpotifyCares It's a gaming PC. SSD, 16 GB 3200mhz blablabla. I don't think my PC isn't working Wells.. And Windows 10
@SpotifyCares From PC. https://t.co/CPy00glRpy
@SpotifyCares Hi Spotify! No offence, but I'm not going to pay €9,99/month just so I could listen to 1 album I like /Emily
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/TRL7njtRJb iPhone 7, seems to be ok today but this song kept showing wrong artwork all yesterday. Small issue I know, just annoying.
@SpotifyCares @706902 Please reply to my concern.
@SpotifyCares I want to download that pic of my sweed with the scan code on. Can I download these codes per track? https://t.co/WT93hiYAkm
@SpotifyCares You’ve lost my business already.
@SpotifyCares currently on 8.4.26.770, only happens on Android it seems
@SpotifyCares From what I can see it just seems to be happening on the desktop app (1.0.67.582.g19436fa3) on my mac, to one private playlist, but I use it all the time so it's a bit annoying
@SpotifyCares Found out what it did shortly after n got v excited thank u for this x
@SpotifyCares iOS, 7 Plus, Spotify Premium v: 8.4.26.793 https://t.co/5MP7hmH0GG
@SpotifyCares Thanks 👍🏻
@SpotifyCares IPhone 7s, latest iOS, latest app update
@SpotifyCares Thanks for getting back to me. How can I add a display name?
@SpotifyCares Additional screenshot https://t.co/dmLxan4T9D
@SpotifyCares I can turn them off but they come back on if I haven't used the app for a while (it generally happens once a day).
@SpotifyCares I'll try both.
@SpotifyCares Still doing it. I open the app, set a song playing from a playlist and it's set to shuffle and repeat once.
@SpotifyCares It's not song specific, but it might be playlist specific. It doesn't happen on my Mac, and I only have this mobile device.
@SpotifyCares will do.. thank you~
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much 💓
@SpotifyCares Bah. Will have to hope more appears soon. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares So, I guess this doesn't "look right" either??? https://t.co/3Izy6BSRka
@SpotifyCares 🙄 knock it off please.
@SpotifyCares Sounds good, thank you 😊
@SpotifyCares Thanks!!! Looking forward 🙏🏻
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I have a member's account already. My music is on Spotify I was trying to get you guys to advertise me more to get more member
@SpotifyCares Do y’all have a date??
@SpotifyCares Nothing in that article really fit into what I think and hear. I might train a server to predict my next song based on data from the past. It looks like I find a cleat pattern. If @115888 wants feedback and or confirm my thoughts they can contact me.
@SpotifyCares Intresting document cant read all but is there anywhere where I contact and explain what I experience? And I will investigate it further on  my end aswell when I have time.
@SpotifyCares Appreciate your response!!
@SpotifyCares It’s “Foxy Shazam” by Foxy Shazam :)
@SpotifyCares Hi.  It's a Lumia 950 XL running 5.2.4.0
@SpotifyCares No.  It's been happening intermittently since I installed Spotify ☹
@SpotifyCares Both
@SpotifyCares dell inspiron 7559 with specs on picture. + brand new creative a250 2.1 sound system. sound cracks on high pitches when listening carefully. i thought my laptop speakers were the cause. now I see, they clearly were not. https://t.co/SICs6j5NzN
@SpotifyCares spotify version is 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares no. didn't help. it's not a major "can't hear" problem. there's always something like static in the sound and i think, this is for everyone using spotify. 320 kbps sound can't be that hard to stream.
@SpotifyCares I want to know if as a business we use Spotify are we covered under prs and ppl licence in the uk?
@SpotifyCares But this isn’t available in the uk as of yet correct?
@SpotifyCares I guess spotify cares for only 1 message, i am still waiting your reply
@SpotifyCares I've been on your list since 2009. Slovenia has been a member of EU longer than that. In fact, when you launched in 2008, Slovenia was already in EU and € was already our currency. Come on, Sweden, catch up, update your maps.
@SpotifyCares Done already! Like years ago! Still waiting.
@SpotifyCares @spotifycares oh, got it, you erased my saved music for like the 6th time.
@SpotifyCares Can you launch in Pakistan please pretty please
@SpotifyCares Apple laptop, most up to date Spotify, now tv advert seems to cause it mainly.
@SpotifyCares Whoa. Y’all actually responded! Back in good graces @115888 ! Sorry @129941 . If this was 2008 you know we’d still be together.
@SpotifyCares Get what you’re saying but #Slade were most successful singles band of 1970s and not having them diminished appeal of @115888
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you!!
@SpotifyCares pls sort this out it is aggravating me TERRIBLY
@SpotifyCares Already deactivated my antivirus AND firewall while I also tried downloading it on a different browser. Everything else works though..
@SpotifyCares Just trying to download the current version from the Spotify site. I have Windows 8.1.
@SpotifyCares So it's working now. Thanks for the responses NS. :)
@SpotifyCares I phone! Beeps really loud every time I change a song with the volume up, and I was wondering if I could turn the beep off.
@SpotifyCares thank you for your concern but its all fixed!
@SpotifyCares laptop, windows
@SpotifyCares It doesn't. Still the same. App says I'm off line. Which isn't true. Wifi and mobile data working. Must log in, then nothing.
@SpotifyCares Hahaha they're not really 145 minutes long, it just comes up with that for some reason. Probably just a bug! Cheers though 😂
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Ooo litty
@SpotifyCares and you downgraded my account in the process.. no email response, just completely reset my account.. ridiculous!!!
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much! Appreciated.
@SpotifyCares Already done! I apologize for my impatience but it seems that everyone on the planet has it except India!
@SpotifyCares halp
@SpotifyCares Version 1.0.67.582 and windows 7
@SpotifyCares The band is called Reparata &amp; The Delrons. 
URI for Reparata: 7pjiMmGVz6Fz9UrHVrSzt3
URI for The Delrons: 1NPWF3RbUvsf767H6exKUH
URI for the album that should be connected to this artist(s): 1HaWPkbjzmSBDUPX0Otrgz

Hopefully this helps.
@SpotifyCares Yes, I just updated to High Sierra and still not working. It also doesn't work on my Windows 10 machine. Maybe it has something to do with language and location? I'm in Spain but my OS's are in English.
@SpotifyCares No error message, clicking in it does nothing, tried several playlists and nothing.
@SpotifyCares Thanks, appreciate it! Doesn’t have to be a button - Just like you touch the top of the screen to get to the🔝 - fast, easy and user friendly📱
@SpotifyCares You've now been called out by several YouTube channels on this: https://t.co/AZxH7JHYpb https://t.co/f33pLEk9DU  You've since updated the app once more without fixing it! @SpotifyCares doesn't care about iPhone X it seems.
@SpotifyCares signing
@SpotifyCares Haha, no issues. Love the time capsule
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares That did it! Thanks! I originally just restarted it, but logging out helped. :)
@SpotifyCares That didnt help, I had to uninstall &amp; re-install the app. It works now.
@SpotifyCares nope it still turns off
@SpotifyCares iphone 6s plus. the version is 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares thanks. I'll try that when I get home.
@SpotifyCares Hi, I've paid Rp 49.990 for 3 months premium offers. But, on my bill it's only for a month. So, for how long I can use my premium? https://t.co/TXv5nH18GK
@SpotifyCares Hi Spotify, I'm in the great U S of A. 

Here's the link: https://t.co/keVTwxMyNt

What do you think?
@SpotifyCares That does work. However, still no sexy sax icon in Genres &amp; Moods...
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I'll do that!
@SpotifyCares I use the iPhone app (iPhone 7), an iMac desktop and a MacBook Pro!
@SpotifyCares Not a specific problem (generally I love the product, on since beta) , I'm rather wondering if there is any reading/transparency on your attitudes and use of tools for suggesting music? I noticed -a feeling, nothing else- than even within my playlists it doesn't feel random
@SpotifyCares I do care about you👌🤣
@SpotifyCares @711375 plz open in ksa
@SpotifyCares yesssss ❤❤❤👌
@SpotifyCares @711373 Not only in Saudi Arabia please.. All of the middle east 💕
@SpotifyCares I think if you were to advertise Touch Preview it would be used a LOT more! Why don’t you guys try that instead of getting rid of it all together.
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.1.2

Thanks
@SpotifyCares Did all that and it is still the same
@SpotifyCares And it’s still the same https://t.co/q0isUVXliA
@SpotifyCares hi! i dont think that is correct. i added them a while back, and it says 'in 6 days' not '6 days ago' like the attached. im just very curious https://t.co/ostQojrmiW
@SpotifyCares And we have no way to access the account.
@SpotifyCares I tried 4 different bank cards but mu payment refused. I am sure that may cards has no problem and enough money in them
@SpotifyCares Sighhhhhhhhhh
@SpotifyCares aww thanks huns
@SpotifyCares Hi again. I followed your links and advice. Completed the I still need help form and have heard nothing? Very concerned about data security as presumably the hacker still has access to my account.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Will take a look.
@SpotifyCares Got it taken care of by a representative  actually thank you though.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for responding certain songs from some of my favorite albums that are older have seemed to been removed what’s up with that?
@SpotifyCares Alright this ain’t the only one. I’ve had “it’s so easy” and other GNR songs removed so if y’all could take care of it that would be great
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares thanks! Will try
@SpotifyCares it only shows two devices.. &amp; my dad got his phone booted off of the off. devices when we added my mom, the 4th member to the fam. acc. why?
@SpotifyCares iphone 6s, ios 11.0.3 ..it’s not showing how much of the song has been played, stops playing my music randomly &amp; fast forwards randomly
@SpotifyCares with wifi, havent disconnect from it so i don’t know if does it with my phones connection. https://t.co/GQ5fzpZtPQ
@SpotifyCares Tried tht a lot of times lol no bueno
@SpotifyCares Wow, thank you!  It's actually been like this for a while. Someone posted a screen shot of it on October 20th https://t.co/P4vxx2dv1W
@SpotifyCares Just DMd you
@SpotifyCares I have tries restarting, reinstalling, redownloading the entire library. Same thing each time 😯 Using Galaxy S7 edge running Android 7
@SpotifyCares *tried
@SpotifyCares Ii would like one of the following to happen shortly please:
1. Completely Refund my latest charge.
2. Charge my the additional remaining charge and change it back to family Premium. If i do not get a reply within 24 hours regarding this i will have to initiate a chargeback.
@SpotifyCares Looks like I need log in more regularly, seems to have worked for now. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares I’ve had a look at my settings and it’s looks as though i am assigned to Spotify free when actually I pay every month for premium
@SpotifyCares All resolved with one of your agents on the site! 

Thanks!
@SpotifyCares yeah course

https://t.co/Er7phUiwUD
@SpotifyCares No, I get that. Been a user for years. Feels like something is off with your algorithm(s). Recommendations have been 💩 for months.
@SpotifyCares On the iPhone 7 when I’m playing a song and click the more tab to start the radio I don’t see that option
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/vpFhpxp2cm
@SpotifyCares Yay !!  Also I did not mean that to come across as Rude sorry
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the tip!! 🙂
@SpotifyCares Desktop only? What about Chromebook?
@SpotifyCares For my website, the app will only let me copy URI instead of URL so I guess I gotta get on the desktop if I want the playlist on my site. https://t.co/rkT0FzPKeK
@SpotifyCares MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015); macOS High Sierra 10.13.1; Apple Aluminum Wired Keyboard
@SpotifyCares Play, ff, etc on kaynoard no longer work
@SpotifyCares Yeah, I know. That’s not what I asked
@SpotifyCares Ok, thank you
@SpotifyCares I didn't have time to attack the problem...waited a few days...it fixed itself. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/yCY0izHihO
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares Awesome! Hope to see the update soon! 🙌🏼
@SpotifyCares It happend before with other songs, but unfortunately I do not remember :-(
Is there a log file I can send you to analyze the situation?
@SpotifyCares I spent like an hour searching on the community section but nothing seems to be working. Thank you though
@SpotifyCares it constantly pauses/plays songs, it skips songs, it crashes
@SpotifyCares Sent. Did you get it?
@SpotifyCares I’ll have to look. It’s windows I know that.
@SpotifyCares See my previous tweet and the numerous threads I’ve created on the comm forum that y’all have given a blanket answer to. “We’ll take this feedback into mind” or “This idea has been tabled” pshhhh
@SpotifyCares Not cool bro, not cool
@SpotifyCares That is ridiculous, that hardly any music at all. I don’t expect any limit for a service I pay to use.
@SpotifyCares Can I customize a mix of all three?
@SpotifyCares Yes, I love the idea of a curated playlist containing both new and familiar artists. I'd like to see more of a variety of tracks from the selected artists too. It's as the algorithm thinks there's only one Fela Kuti song worth hearing!
@SpotifyCares Android 7.0, Spotify 8.4.26.770 armV7
@SpotifyCares I think this fixed it? Thanks KB
@SpotifyCares Uh. Guys. It's happening again https://t.co/UTOvGRmxmX
@SpotifyCares Followed all the steps but alas https://t.co/b57RT61nUP
@SpotifyCares ☹ https://t.co/WdQuLzFRAN
@SpotifyCares No, just that one ad.
@SpotifyCares Works on macOS. I think I need the ads turned off on Android for 30 to 90 days to gather a control dataset for comparison.
@SpotifyCares That’s not a mashup though...
@SpotifyCares Similar to what Spotify currently does with running playlist
@SpotifyCares Haha thanks for being kind of to reply, was getting really tired of waiting for Spotify to be available here so I decided to take matters on my own hand xD Cheers have a nice day!
@SpotifyCares Netflix, Amazon VOD, Uber is here, you guys should definitely think about coming to Bangladesh before going public and just so you know we're a country with over 160M population xD
@SpotifyCares yea, usually it’s ok, and I love a lot of old white guys, but man, what I wouldn’t give for a “ban alll Grateful Dead and Eagles associated artists to hell” button CC @97498
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I hope so cos I miss the old song
@SpotifyCares The song has completely changed, sounds so different and it’s disappointing
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6S Plus, v 11.1.1, spotify v 8.4.26.793 (missing on Windows 10 pro version 1.0.60.492.gbb40dab8 as well, though I use this only rarely). User name is christopher1229 Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Yup. Saw that earlier. Doesn't solve the problem. The only mix that disappeared is the one that I play a lot and try to modify with likes and dislikes, etc. I had four, and now just three that I never listen to. Seems like a glitch to me.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Just those two “Musica Cristiana” albums, btw! https://t.co/oLZl5BDFEX
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6S, IOS 11.0.2. Playlists won’t shuffle. Button turns off when it goes to the next song. Have deleted and reinstalled several times
@SpotifyCares I’m logged in with my FB account, “Ben Calvin”
@SpotifyCares I don’t share what I’m listening to with my followers. And I mostly stream from my discovery - but I also stream some other stuff..
@SpotifyCares Just the songs.. the playlists are there 😨
@SpotifyCares Ok, I'll do it. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Thank you @115888 for satisfying another customer  this is why you'll always be better than @115948
@SpotifyCares Using Spotify Android Version 8.4.26.770. Android 7.1.1 on Samsung Note 8. Chromecast Audio Cast firmware version: 1.28.100555.
@SpotifyCares Private network.
@SpotifyCares I'm not receiving any on-screen errors. Only audio cut-outs. It also occurs when casting to a Google Home.
@SpotifyCares Oh ok thank you.
@SpotifyCares I pressed change payment detail then entered my credit card info and then pressed continue and it’s stuck loading, it’s been loading for 40 minutes
@SpotifyCares I’ll give it a try, thanks
@SpotifyCares Can you guys also add the friends feature on the mobile app so I can creep on my friends?! 👀
@SpotifyCares I knew that was a thing when i subscribed 4 years ago i just didnt think that you wanna chase customers away, or worse, to hacked versions.
@SpotifyCares I mean that why Spotify Spain do not post anything of @133324 xdxd
@SpotifyCares spotify:album:6GlsmhwCxNCEmW8v2YVPRN
@SpotifyCares wow thank you but can I get an IU song instead ily
@SpotifyCares @97700 hi again! i just really love westlife and that album so i'd really appreciate a reason as to why it's not on there anymore! btw i love spotify it amazing and outsold Apple Music x
@SpotifyCares All kinds of issues.. the Spotify app is freezing, clicking play on songs does nothing, I have to restart the spotify app on my phone constantly, the app works about 10% of the time
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.2, Spotify 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares Apple Music and Podcast app work fine
@SpotifyCares Since I purchased my new car that had Apple CarPlay a month ago
@SpotifyCares 2017 Honda Civic
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately I’ve requested a reset link several times but i never receive it even by junk mail
@SpotifyCares Why did amazon say Spotify support for multiroom audio would be coming soon when it was launched? @115821 @115888
@SpotifyCares @115821 @115888 https://t.co/7USBkVfmSy
@SpotifyCares Brooooo im real life struggling and I need the spotify premium b
@SpotifyCares Sure... I just found out what DM is (lol) but I don't know how to do it! Can you direct me please?
@SpotifyCares Spotify version? 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3  that right? And OS version: 10.13.1 (17B48)
@SpotifyCares @132062 Same issue here. Media controls on touch bar no longer work
@SpotifyCares After my mac updated to the new High Sierra OS
@SpotifyCares It’s a 2017 Sony Bravia Xbr-65x930e . software version pkg6.2676.0070NAA
@SpotifyCares Mic search working on vevo and youtube but the mic function is more integrated in those two apps. No way to disable google assistant, according to Sony tech support this is an update forced on all new models. I can type in searches still just much easier to just speak.
@SpotifyCares I haven’t figured that out, this google assistant stuff is new to me. I’m pretty sure within the Spotify app I could just search by pressing the mic button from the search field and saying what I wanted.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 5S, v. 8.4.26. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I can add the podcast using desktop app. But on mobile I can't add, view or remove the podcast.

Now I'm following the podcasts but can't see or unfollow them on mobile. Not ideal.

Same goes for the Radiolab podcast.
@SpotifyCares @167274  help me
@SpotifyCares Yeah, it's hafellfox.
@SpotifyCares Upset with the service..
@SpotifyCares Microsoft 10, Surface laptop. Version 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3

Samsung Galaxy S8, v 8.4.26.770 armV7
@SpotifyCares Uhh sharing songs you’ve saved to your music but as an entire playlist to send to someone. Also being able to create a log in so I don’t have to use Facebook
@SpotifyCares @132062 Same here. Using touch bar model, I can only pause music from the Spotify app, not the media controls on touch bar. Please fix
@SpotifyCares Oh no it's not that I'm missing it.  It's just that it doesn't exist.  It needs to be added
@SpotifyCares America . Please hurry I need to listen to Justin Vernons sweet voice singing I can't make you love me . I pay for Spotify premium I deserve this
@SpotifyCares Thx. I was able to register using the main website
@SpotifyCares @497318 Definitely need some sort of rewards system in place for us lifetime subscribers
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/MZpACvldHc Eden link, incorrect album https://t.co/Yvkn7BvDSG
@SpotifyCares Another question. I have a Spotify account through tuncore. I don't control it what so ever. Is that possible to get verified.
@SpotifyCares (and sorry for the typo!! *two artists!! 🙈🙈🙈)
@SpotifyCares Been there, done that my friend !
Still clueless and incapable of preventing that from happening again and again...
@SpotifyCares Yes I have, twice in 2 days and my new account has been accessed to within a few hours although ALL precautions have been taken
I basically can't have a premium account until you install proper security measures (maybe look at what Google does with double passwords...)
@SpotifyCares Already did waiting for response. Seems my account was terminated by the hackers while I was waiting. Hopefully they can recover something.
@SpotifyCares @718650 Still can't access my account...
@SpotifyCares The facebook staff already solved it, thanks !
@SpotifyCares Had to completely reboot phone. It was after a password change. Got a pop up when I started the app, then after that the buttons wouldn’t work. Closed app and restarted, same. Then rebooted phone and it worked. Thanks for the follow up.
@SpotifyCares I have no idea what the email address is...😂. Let me see if I can figure it out.
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.1.1    Spotify 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares Updating to Spotify 8.4.27 right now
@SpotifyCares I have the most recent version of spotify. I restarted my phone too. The option on the top right corner isn’t there where it would normally be. https://t.co/6nCzUnNOc1
@SpotifyCares It worked! Thank you!
@SpotifyCares I will stay tuned however... to @193255 on @115948 since they do have support for #iPhoneX #peaceout ✌🏼
@SpotifyCares It’s considerably more steps to toggle offline mode and no clear indication it’s on. You could definitely improve in this area.
@SpotifyCares What can I do to resolve this issue only way I can listen to music at work please please please help me out
@SpotifyCares hi, just gonna ask why I cant login to my spotify when I'm abroad.. like few months ago when I were in Japan&amp;China, I can't login to my spotify account..
@SpotifyCares Spotify premium for family, who joining the plan must be stay at same home address?
@SpotifyCares Thanks, dude. iPhone 7, iOS 11, version 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares Would ya look at that I’m in the upside down https://t.co/OLVKA9KWKr
@SpotifyCares USA
@SpotifyCares Hope it all works out
@SpotifyCares It’s only let me import the file from my files and folders on my MacBook, it still won’t let me import library from iTunes:(
@SpotifyCares No ! That was just an ITunes Normal subscription where I could listen to songs and download them to listen offline I didn’t buy any songs on iTunes
@SpotifyCares @719717 why is the comment section messed up? What happened to the pages 50-141?
@SpotifyCares Probably 5000 or more.😅 I really like my jams, so it's hard to tell, but that's my best estimate. 😁
@SpotifyCares To whom ever I am speaking to, thanks for the help!✨⭐️ If I have anymore concerns, best believe I will not hesitate to ask!😇
@SpotifyCares I'm aware, just sad, there are worse problems to worry about ❤️
@SpotifyCares I've tried doing it, and also deleting the app and then reinstalling it. Neither seems to work
@SpotifyCares I'm using an iphone 6+ and on version 8.4.24
@SpotifyCares Just updated the application to version 8.4.25, everything running smoothly now. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares im mentally retarded and ur actually replying to me god bless you
@SpotifyCares put brockhampton on the front page RIGHT now
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+ 
Ios 11.0.3. Spotify 8.4.24.506
@SpotifyCares Didn’t work
@SpotifyCares No Lil peep - Hellboy
@SpotifyCares @116380 spotify:artist:6D8m8pBw3RkQ1TAi1bF2e1
@SpotifyCares I read it
@SpotifyCares oh thank you
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares Sure, Chrome (v. 62.0.3202.94, latest), problem was in the web-player, not in the desktop app. Anyway, it was fixed later that day.
@SpotifyCares what about on November 17???
@SpotifyCares just stop taking off dua lipa of my playlist
@SpotifyCares i only saw the IDGAF so i don’t know about the others
@SpotifyCares Thanks. It's all on normal recommended. It must be wrong. I literally have two playlists 70 songs each and 2 albums with 21 songs. I can't download anymore. Makes no sense having premium. Help
@SpotifyCares Windows 10
@SpotifyCares Ok awesome! I can’t wait to get the update.
@SpotifyCares I haven’t received anything
@SpotifyCares I got verified before I had the chance to! I apologize, and thank you very much (:
@SpotifyCares Cheers for the reply guys and awesome please do pass it on, spend so much time putting regularly updated playlists to top and seems like a fairly simple feature to add :)
@SpotifyCares Just to clarify I mean the new email address is fake!
@SpotifyCares It's working again, thankfully!
@SpotifyCares @722554 Take Care is a classic. Y'all better get that shit back up ASAP 😒😅
@SpotifyCares dope thanks!
@SpotifyCares ♥️♥️♥️♥️ y'all are so nice, i'm glad i switched back from apple music 😭
@SpotifyCares Yes, I switched to the web player for now. The client is nicer but I am not comfortable with having unknown services open on untrusted networks. :) 
It would be nice to be able to disable P2P function even if it deteriorates fluidity.
Thank you for the answer.
@SpotifyCares Hello, I get this: https://t.co/S66SZSIUu8
@SpotifyCares It still says unsupported even after going incognito
@SpotifyCares SONOS:Play1, Spotify Mac 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3, macOS 10.13.1 (17B48). No errors. Controlling/connection is intermittent.
@SpotifyCares Private WiFi network. Logged out of all devices. Restarted all devices. Factory reset and reconnected Sonos. Sonos works fine from Sonos app but not from any Spotify client.
@SpotifyCares No. Controlling other Spotify clients and AirPlay devices works fine. Restarted the router but no luck 😕
@SpotifyCares Hello! No, that's not the case.
@SpotifyCares I am always using incognito browsing =))
@SpotifyCares Will do, thanks!
@SpotifyCares thank you King
@SpotifyCares 8.4.26.770 Android 7.0 on S7 Edge thanks
@SpotifyCares Nope, no difference. Tried mobile and WiFi #sadface
@SpotifyCares I don't have device anymore.  I tried using option to logout from all devices and it don't work for sonos
@SpotifyCares Nope, there was no crash, this has been an on-going issue and no matter how many times I see the ads, I never get a full 30 minutes of ad-free music.
@SpotifyCares Yes, for example, I watched a Geico commercial at approx 6.48am and I had another ad playing at approx 7am.
@SpotifyCares Will do. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares Thanks, signed up for that last night. Just waiting on approval email!
@SpotifyCares Sweet thanks!
@SpotifyCares Both. Samsung galaxy S7 edge and whichever js newest OS.
@SpotifyCares Only with wifi so far and no doesn't seem to help.
@SpotifyCares That does help but it messes up again soon after.
@SpotifyCares I got the notification through days ago saying I'd paid for spotify but have literally gotten no use out of it.
@SpotifyCares How can you say you ‘care’ when you obviously have #preset #responses and aren’t interested into looking into the actual complaints #spotifyforgets #transparencynow
@SpotifyCares Yes I have questions, firstly what team? When will they review? What is the teams email so we can contact directly? How much data do you need to create similar artist radio? #answers #notdistractions #spotify
@SpotifyCares I guess ill spend the next day or two trying to redwnload AGAIN everything manually artist by artist but with the setting on hi quality this time. 1900+ songs...what a pain in the ass this is gonna be.
@SpotifyCares Please hurry up. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares No you completely missed the question. I already have a station from a playlist. If I add new songs to the originating playlist does the station based on that playlist update dynamically? Or do I have to manually recreate the station from the playlist again
@SpotifyCares But do I have to regenerate the station for those changes to take effect? Or will the station do it automatically?
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares actually entire take care album is messed up and it's missing a song. I try to play a song and it just bounces around the album and plays a random song. I checked other albums and artists and take care is the only one that's doing this...
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/8PU6eE3RDO
@SpotifyCares Like I would select the song right before HYFR and then in the bottom it would say HYFR is loading up and then it seemed like the album crashed the app would stay open but the bar at the bottom to show what music you have on would glitch out and disappear only with this album
@SpotifyCares This is a screenshot after I selected "go to album" should show all songs and it's actually missing 2 HYFR is supposed to go after look what you've done and another song the ride is supposed to go after practice https://t.co/TrlmpTyodm
@SpotifyCares Just has the ui friendlyness of trying to ride a camel with 3 humps. Samsung s7. Search for a song. Dont get the song i get the artist and asked to shuffle. Tried to add the song to a list. Was like working out whp did 9/11
@SpotifyCares Sounds good and thanks for the reply!
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/3momkniHKD
@SpotifyCares no just the message: loading, please wait... - and so nothing happens on the credit card update site.
@SpotifyCares Aha, the "new window" did the trick! So you will still get my money in the future 🙂 Thx for helping out.
@SpotifyCares Please pass it on, it’s a very weird system not to allow updating address without deleting the account. Thanks, but my situation is okay for now!
@SpotifyCares iP7, 11.0.3... Search/Category &gt; PLP UX is atrocious. Sub. $, so why fix it unless I cancel my acct.? No need to optimize funnel. Feels like Vista security prompts.
@SpotifyCares Sure (I assume PIP) post-song engagement. DM a # and I’ll call.
@SpotifyCares 260 won’t cut it - I’m not doing a multi tweet on how to help curate your Content pages post search/browse
@SpotifyCares Yes, Drake’s album. it was on last night and now it’s off!
@SpotifyCares @584088 You reply to people everyday regarding this issue. Surely that's enough to know people want this feature. So just put it back.
@SpotifyCares Getting error 
3 - Oops something went wrong, please try again.
@SpotifyCares This is what it actually says is my username. I only have 1 account https://t.co/ZiG96W3Ukj
@SpotifyCares But I'm logged in as the one I created https://t.co/DCQH48xWo1
@SpotifyCares Awesome, thanks. 👍
@SpotifyCares its set to united states
@SpotifyCares The album. The United States
@SpotifyCares I know! iPhone 7, version 8.4.27, should be the most recent one!
@SpotifyCares As far as I have noticed it happens with both albums and playlists, after a while they still appear on my saved music library but they are not available offline (even though I have previously downloaded them). Thank you for the response, I sincerely hope you can solve this :)
@SpotifyCares Is it based on downloaded songs or play time? I’m a premium subscriber and have almost all of his songs on my account but never received a presale code
@SpotifyCares @723972 Y’all better fix this soon, this album is important to my mental health
@SpotifyCares @723972 I'm listening in the USA y'all on some bullshit lemme try to restart
@SpotifyCares How many votes will this need to be approved?
@SpotifyCares For the first time in 8 months you changed the version history field!!! 👏 👏👏👏 #spotify #iphoneXlaunch https://t.co/1dHhPCu9kC
@SpotifyCares So free premium for life or do I have to switch to Apple Music since they have take care
@SpotifyCares May you dm me @6860 phone number or email? I need to talk to him ASAP. I gotta jam to my favorite album.
@SpotifyCares Hi there. I'm using a HTC 10 with Android 7.0. The Spotify version is 8.4.26.770.
@SpotifyCares WiFi and mobile data indeed. I'm not sure if it happens to downloaded tracks, I believe it's happening to downloaded and non-downloaded.
@SpotifyCares Will try that and let you know as soon as it's slow again.
@SpotifyCares this is cool
@SpotifyCares Super strange! Is started happening last night. I’ve got an iPhone 8+ running 11.1.1
@SpotifyCares Dang that didn’t do it :(. When Snapchat opens, Spotify fades out. I’m betting it’s an iPhone issue. You guys rule, and the service is perfect otherwise. So it’s gotta be Snapchat or an iOS thing.
@SpotifyCares I'm aware of the limit, and it ruins the entire purpose of your service. That's the point I'm trying to make here. 10,000 songs is maybe a fifth of what should reasonably be available.
@SpotifyCares I started paying for Spotify in 2015, it took less than two years to hit the limit. That was last year. I haven't stopped discovering music and not being able to save those songs defeats the purpose of what I'm paying for.
@SpotifyCares When I first decided to pay for your service I was resolved to being a lifetime customer, the idea being that I would expand my tastes and build a personal library within your service over time. Well forget the library; 10K songs is barely an iPod.
@SpotifyCares I appreciate your efforts at curation, I understand your priority is on playlists, and on developing engaging content related to music, but is Spotify just a service for casual listening? What about those of us who love albums?
@SpotifyCares Hi, I subscribed to spotify premium 10 days ago and my account doesn’t work. tomorrow I have a 6h on the road..  activate my account please?
@SpotifyCares Cheers
@SpotifyCares + create a new one where I have to add all family members again?
@SpotifyCares USA
@SpotifyCares Not the album but thanks anyways. I meant to say you guys should add a "you might also like" feature with suggested albums at the bottom
@SpotifyCares 8.4.24.506 and iOS 11.0.3
@SpotifyCares 🤦🏿‍♂️ Ashanti was never on into you. Ever! Not on a remix, single, dj remix, techno remix nothing. Blasphemy I tell you
@SpotifyCares please do :/
@SpotifyCares I also sent you a dm, pls check it out
@SpotifyCares IOS 11.1.1 https://t.co/u5xOPAQubw
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/pDN5nxuriU
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.1.1 and its an iPhone 6SE. Was working yesterday morning, now since the update, it is no more
@SpotifyCares Seems to have worked, thanks
@SpotifyCares Yes! Always click and let it play through to the next song while in the car
@SpotifyCares Nope! May have been a fluke :)
@SpotifyCares Thanks! The headphones are TaoTronics and the car is a Toyota.
@SpotifyCares Google Pixel phone, Oreo OS, and I've just reinstalled Spotify so I'll try it again now to see if that fixed it!
@SpotifyCares It didn't work with reinstalled Spotify on my phone with the headphones so I'm assuming the problem is still there :(
@SpotifyCares Hi! I'm referring to the entire album by drake. It's set to United States
@SpotifyCares I downloaded the newest version on my desktop as well and the incident is still occurring
@SpotifyCares I hope so. It's my favorite album 😔
@SpotifyCares Still nothing :(
@SpotifyCares Restarted but still nothing. I am on Windows 10.
@SpotifyCares It plays on my phone, just getting nothing on my computer.
@SpotifyCares There is no error, I just click play and nothing happens.
@SpotifyCares I took a lunch break and now it seems to be working??? Not sure what happened. Do you still want my info?
@SpotifyCares sure. iphone 6. latest spotify and iOS versions. https://t.co/OitfjL4RS2
@SpotifyCares when i close and swipe the app up and reopen it's fine. but then after a while of playing music the same thing happens.
@SpotifyCares Can I get a follow whilst you’re here🤔😉
@SpotifyCares figure it out
@SpotifyCares its set to the U.S, it's not coming up in the albums https://t.co/xBnmIaMcjJ
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+ w/ 11.1, I Press “play”, step in the shower, music fades out like there’s a notification, but there is no notification 🤷🏼‍♂️
@SpotifyCares I’ll be damned, there’s an update available. Completely unaware, my bad, I’ll update and see if that helps. Sorry to bother!
@SpotifyCares Doesn't look like Apple Music has a problem with the "licensing". How can you have every album from drake but not his best one yet? You're not sorry, you're pathetic.
@SpotifyCares Thx. But now i have another problem. I don't see 'behind the lyrics' anymore. I reinstalled spotify and logged in again, didn't work tho. I tested songs, that I'm 100% sure they have 'behind the lyrics'.
@SpotifyCares Doesn't work either. :/
@SpotifyCares @725075 @6860 @115888 Why not just say that?
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I have been streaming this for months..can't wait for #Reputation
@SpotifyCares 😊😊👍
@SpotifyCares Thank you bro
@SpotifyCares Artist: https://t.co/raonjdlcjK
Albums: https://t.co/I8h3Laa1Np and https://t.co/pKE5BjBGWH
Song: https://t.co/MOq9TxgAPp
@SpotifyCares Hey thx - solved it by downloading the desktop app and doing some things in settings
@SpotifyCares Thanks babe
@SpotifyCares France, as usual. I never change it
@SpotifyCares hi there I didn't *think* it was High Sierra, which I updated a while ago, as I only noticed when updated Spotify this morning. Was working yesterday. BUT same issue with iTunes.  What you think?
@SpotifyCares When i try to search anything it only searches my account. If i enter a new artist it says it cant find?
@SpotifyCares Reinstalled and its still the same issue
@SpotifyCares hurry y’all i’m tryna bump it in this weather 😭☔️
@SpotifyCares I meant take care by Drake brooooo but good looks
@SpotifyCares 8.4.26.770 armV7
@SpotifyCares It seems to be the same issue that iPhoneX users are seeing as well.
@SpotifyCares Show me Spotify truly cares by giving the curation team a nudge in right direction 🤙🏻
@SpotifyCares That’s what I’ve been doing but it keeps pulling the same song from the same artist just on a different compilation album! It’s really frustrating when they pull the same Beatles song from five different albums
@SpotifyCares get my account back!! Yeeiiyyy! Thank you team! 😘
@SpotifyCares Sorry but none if the advices that are listed there fixed the problem and now it also started to delete the artists I follow
@SpotifyCares I have m Spotify-account via my Facebook-account so I don't know which email address you exactly want
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/mXafxG8R8O USA “Maladjusted” not the expanded one
@SpotifyCares It is
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares Hell yeah Goodlooks @115888
@SpotifyCares Ok so they have to make the artist profile for me  and all of that ? I shouldn’t try/do it myself ?
@SpotifyCares Yes I am using iOS 11 on the iPhone X
@SpotifyCares So I did that and it did not work. I deleted the app, reinstalled it and played a song, while the song was playing I went YouTube clicked on the video and it started playing. I stopped the YouTube video and went back to Spotify but the song would not play again.
@SpotifyCares I tried, but nope, it didn't help.
@SpotifyCares nope. only these 4 songs https://t.co/2R2onW03xi
@SpotifyCares I will try it out. Is that the only solution you guys have? Because I just saw this issue being posted about for months now. And it's pretty ongoing without a solution it seems.
@SpotifyCares Oh, that’s why! Thank you for the quick response! :)
@SpotifyCares How do I find my username if I've always logged in with Facebook ? Thanks :)
@SpotifyCares Samsung phone. Latest Android
Free version at the moment
@SpotifyCares So the free version doesn't let you play your own playlists?? Is that right??
@SpotifyCares Yeah. It means I can't see how well the service works before I pay, so thanks anyway. I'll stick to google music.
@SpotifyCares When I used my friends &amp; dads account it allowed me to listen to music that wasn’t  downloaded (they have premium). When I’m in the car &amp; go to choose a song I don’t have saved/downloaded it automatically stops around 10 seconds ...
@SpotifyCares Ios version 11.1.1
Spotify version 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares Restarting the phone works for now. I’ve tried it before as well as reinstalling the app. But, I’ll see how long it’ll last
@SpotifyCares Thank you! The end of year customised stats + playlists are my favourite thing about Spotify 🙏🏻
@SpotifyCares The only thing @115888 could do to help is to make upgrading from Premium to Family possible without canceling your account for people who signed up for premium through Apple. (What should be) A simple one step process took me 30 minutes this morning
@SpotifyCares Just did some tests. It happens every time I connect to my car, USB or Bluetooth.
@SpotifyCares i dont remember since i deleted and re installed the app, but it was just saying how they're on tour and tickets being on sale?
@SpotifyCares none of those things are relevant to my situation.. still Spotify removes my songs
@SpotifyCares It better be back soon👀
@SpotifyCares We both can't listen to music at the same time.
@SpotifyCares Thanks, guys! 😀
@SpotifyCares We've been going 4 years strong. I expect more out of our relationship
@SpotifyCares That's all I ask 💜💜 I know we can make this work
@SpotifyCares When trying to launch Spotify web player today it's requiring a new setting in Chrome which is not available in my current Linux version
@SpotifyCares "Allow protected content", or DRM media in Firefox
@SpotifyCares I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 running Android 5.0 - My laptop is running Windows 10. I look forward to hearing back soon...   Thank you!
@SpotifyCares but will you actually or are you just saying that to make me feel good
@SpotifyCares Hopefully u guys launch it in south Africa soon https://t.co/jftemNq2f9
@SpotifyCares Its ok its all fine now aha
@SpotifyCares No. But some releases aren’t included. I have to learn about them on my own then search for them.
@SpotifyCares If it's not back by tomorrow I'm switching to spinrilla
@SpotifyCares Thanks for replying ! My mac is under OS Sierra (version 10.12.6) and I’ve uptdated my Spotify desk app to the latest version for sure (but I can’t find the precise information of the exact name sorry) 1/2
@SpotifyCares My main pb it takes a long while for the app to start working properly, especially the “central” page of the app. It’s also slow when I change from one page to the other (like from “discover” to “albums” 2/2
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I’ll try that!
@SpotifyCares USA!
@SpotifyCares ok but can i change my display name on my old account hfdsjfs
@SpotifyCares Having access to your playlists would be nice, along with all the other songs in your library. Maybe some access to top charts.
@SpotifyCares Hello :) iPhone 6s and Spotify version 8.4.27
@SpotifyCares Terrible decision. But thanks anyway ❤️
@SpotifyCares Thank, I guess it’s much clearer now. :)
@SpotifyCares You guys even changed my profile picture. It was the cover for “turnin” and now it’s no where on there.
@SpotifyCares you completely miss the point. i don't WANT to have to install an app. the whole POINT of an 'embedded player' is to PLAY WHERE IT IS.
@SpotifyCares to be clear: i do not have you app installed nor want. if this is required... embedded player is merely an "open in our app" link.
@SpotifyCares It was more tongue-in-cheek. I think I am getting old :D
@SpotifyCares Hello. 😀 Thanks, but I'm on your waiting list for 2 years already 😂
@SpotifyCares Okay, thanks for getting back to me :)
@SpotifyCares I just cant believe that after 2 days it’s not fixed. You can’t imagine the trouble this is causing. Is this gonna happen with all of my new singles? @115888 @125633 @SpotifyCares thinking seriously about not using spotify anymore in that case.
@SpotifyCares Misleidende reclame in Nederlandse taal, antwoord in Engels....nog meer verwarring en doorlinken??
@SpotifyCares @730865 Is this available through smart and globe load payment?
@SpotifyCares well it has caused the screen to freeze before (the next ad wouldn’t play and I’d have to re start the app) but it’s just very repetitive, I get the ad quite a lot in comparison to other ad’s, and i am not a child nor parent so won’t be buying the cd aha x
@SpotifyCares Ios 11.1.2 and the latest spotify whatever that is
@SpotifyCares No that hasnt fixed it 😭😭
@SpotifyCares Its becoming inbearable. I cant listen to anything with headphones in. I am going to unsubscribe from premium if it continues
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 11.0.2
@SpotifyCares none of these apply to me ! 🙁 it’s fine when i get home i’ll get back online and download them again thanks though!
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares it won't even let me back in my account this person changed my email to his😭😭😭
@SpotifyCares Which one do i go to I don't see one for being hacked??? https://t.co/GQzw3SHuAy
@SpotifyCares ....ok spotify I got help Michelle is the mvp for helping me get my account back...😔😔but he deleted all my playlists and all my music can u help?
@SpotifyCares I don't want to cancel. I just dont like having auto renew on
@SpotifyCares Francesqa* (band). They’ve got other “less popular” material on Spotify though. Can users request tracks?
@SpotifyCares thanks!
@SpotifyCares Do you recall which ticketing service it was?
@SpotifyCares Please do, if anything they deserve recognition
@SpotifyCares Very well. Should blame my province's laws then. Thank you for the answer.
@SpotifyCares I used space so it wouldn't change the site
@SpotifyCares I try to log in and this site shows up https:// www.spotify. com / us/ static/ login-error/
@SpotifyCares im using mac
@SpotifyCares I checked them once, then i checked them twice, oh.
@SpotifyCares Ah cheers
@SpotifyCares yeah it completley stops
@SpotifyCares hi im using iphone 8 plus latest ios 11.1.2 with most up to date spotify app
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/G6J9keroaj #10 'bored of canada' is greyed out, doesn't show up in searches
@SpotifyCares Should be Netherlands
@SpotifyCares What about visa gift cards?
@SpotifyCares Where to go for the student discounts?
@SpotifyCares You vanished???
@SpotifyCares @Spotifycares this is the second time I've had ads with swearing while listening to Christmas music with my 2 year old. Not everyone in the world is cool with profanity. Anything you can do here?
@SpotifyCares It wasn't the music- it was the ads you played in between the music. I don't listen to explicit music with my 2 year old.
@SpotifyCares Can't remove battery but will try rebooting. I'll let you know if that helps.
@SpotifyCares Honor 8
Android 7.0
Spotify 8.4.26.770

Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Sweden
@SpotifyCares Hi, see you in a few years on my Spotify internship.😘😘😘😘
@SpotifyCares That’s stupid tho. I pay y’all. Give me what i pay for
@SpotifyCares Oh damn, thanks for the reply. Didn’t expect one, sorry for my rudeness haha.
@SpotifyCares Thank you Spotify I know you care I always trusted you. You’re like an Aunty to me. Never leave me. Im bouTTA START THROWING HANGS AT BigSHIT THO WASSGUD https://t.co/18kX1gpAIS
@SpotifyCares Yet another disappointing response. At least it ins't a copy paste this time. It is already one of the top voted ideas that hasn't had any comment since the feature was ripped out a year and a half ago. I'll see you again in 6 months.
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I think part of the problem might be iOS. Could have sworn I updated my phone last night but I may require another. Spotify is version 8.4.27
@SpotifyCares THANK YOU!!
@SpotifyCares I Listen to him all the time and no I did not get an email 😣😣🤪🤪😭😭😭😤😤@105934 helppp
@SpotifyCares @732384 HI I need the code too
@SpotifyCares @136314 @118062
@SpotifyCares Did the reference number I give you give you enough information to pull up my account?
@SpotifyCares Our label has already emailed about this problem last week and hasn't gotten a response
@SpotifyCares Well all I see is a bunch of people complaining about the same problem going all the way back to 2012. Here’s my feed back, because you should take it from every forum not just yours, make an algorithm that doesn’t play the same artist more than once in a row. Why is that hard
@SpotifyCares I think I have an answer! But thanks for looking into it 😄
@SpotifyCares Found it, but there's no songs https://t.co/THtu3maVRd
@SpotifyCares I've done it, and still no songs😢
@SpotifyCares Hi, it was actually on the webplayer...
@SpotifyCares thanks - i'll give it a go!
@SpotifyCares The mixtape Agust D is still the same; it doesn’t show up for searches unless I use the exact link, and it can’t be played when I find it.
@SpotifyCares oh hey ! i didn't expect a reply ! im using a chromebook and its on the web so idk the version
@SpotifyCares it just happened today. ill try and see what happens
@SpotifyCares Any update?
@SpotifyCares Hello, my problem solve already. Thanks to Spotify Support.
@SpotifyCares Yasssss!!!!
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/oheu41GJcD
@SpotifyCares the album Evolution, most of their discography is not available in my area.
@SpotifyCares Ahh, a wee reinstall. What about all the music I've downloaded? Will I have to manually do it again?
@SpotifyCares And how does one sync my tunes or is it automatic to my desktop version when I D/L them to my phone?
@SpotifyCares I am shook
@SpotifyCares Ya
@SpotifyCares (yeah, I mean to say it’s working now, and I’m logged in okay but I’m not sure what was causing that to begin with).
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares It works now however when I tried again (the working time) it pushed several empty “Log In” titled pages and I had to press “Back” several times to get to the two buttons again so I could press Log In again and then it worked.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/LDLaXmMLI0
@SpotifyCares Done, thanks!!!
@SpotifyCares wait, it seems to be working now
@SpotifyCares Great! Thank you! 😊
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response!
@SpotifyCares Just saw the update and downloaded it. Looking good guys!  Thanks so much!
@SpotifyCares Playlist buddy @101521
@SpotifyCares @101521 If you guys fix this for me I will love you even more
@SpotifyCares i meant undo revoke access, not do revoke access. I accidently revoked access to playlist buddy but i want to undo it.
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much &lt;3
@SpotifyCares There we go! Thanks for the update 🎧
@SpotifyCares wow Thank you
@SpotifyCares Windows 10, Spotify Desktop app latest one i think because i havent got any update since last week but the point is, When the Spotify freeze, the whole dekstop freeze, since early this year iv been using it.
@SpotifyCares The laptop is unresponsive. I cant even move the cursor. Had to cut off the computer's power then turn back on
@SpotifyCares Sometimes, yes.
@SpotifyCares Thanks bae
@SpotifyCares Roku app not phone app
@SpotifyCares iPhone 5S, iOS version 11.0.1, latest Spotify apps.
@SpotifyCares No, it still isn’t listed.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/CRuIeN4oH3
@SpotifyCares Yeah I figured, the app appears to be pretty outdated. Oh well! Thanks, hope it gets updated! For now there’s always the PS4.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I appreciate the reply.
@SpotifyCares bump
@SpotifyCares I have submitted the broken/incorrect link a few times and it hasn’t been corrected. My band has the same name as a band of a different genre
@SpotifyCares It’s through my label. I have gone through the proper channels as far as I can tell. Really not sure what more I/we can do on our end
@SpotifyCares Hello Spotify - i can log into my account and even edit, but I’m somehow locked out of managing my Family Plan account.
@SpotifyCares When I opened the link it said the song was not available ??
@SpotifyCares Not at this moment but it has happened before ... the currently play bar blocks the home buttons making me have to swipe to close
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+, iOS 11.1.1 ... I already swiped to close https://t.co/61po4jfisE
@SpotifyCares What i need is to know when revival comes out 👍🏻
@SpotifyCares dm me it bruh
@SpotifyCares United States. Other people from Europe (Germany / UK) say they still have it but we don't
@SpotifyCares Yep it’s my iPhone 5 and it’s running 11.1.2
@SpotifyCares No the ad doesn’t come up at all, it’s just black except for the Learn More button.  Also the pause button is visible, but if you hit it it just shows the play button but still black screen behind.  It was this eve, guessing around 6:30 pm pst
@SpotifyCares Nope not at all, I already tried this on my computer and it did the exact same thing. I've logged out of everything and deleted all the apps
@SpotifyCares S8+, Android 7, latest Spotify version
@SpotifyCares Again? Like last time? And re-download my 22gb library that literally takes 15 hours to download and then have the same bug come up again? The app is *terrible*.
@SpotifyCares I’m sure there is something great in the works.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply! iPhone 8+, iOS 11.1.1, Spotify 8.4.27.895 - SS attached, “Tear in Your Hand” is one of the songs that won’t play. https://t.co/PIYTHKLEDo
@SpotifyCares No error message, a little gray bar pops up at the bottom of the screen when I tap a song but it doesn’t play at all :(
@SpotifyCares Tried that and still have the same problem.
@SpotifyCares Nope, same behavior for Offline Mode turned on or off.
@SpotifyCares When will it be on there?????
@SpotifyCares Okay, thank you! 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
@SpotifyCares Appreciate it...those are my main genres I listen to...like the app and would like to stay with you guys but I like new music and I really like seeing what's new on Fridays. Thanks for the reply. Peace.
@SpotifyCares Sorry I was rude 🤗
@SpotifyCares @735719 I bought the physical copy to support her... I just want to be able to hear it wherever I go...
@SpotifyCares oh okay! thanks! ☺☺
@SpotifyCares Goldlink
@SpotifyCares v8.4.27, iPhone, iOS 11.0.2 – I found a recent 5-page thread of Mazda owners with same problem: https://t.co/APGA5M0mhg
@SpotifyCares Thanks for reaching out! I'm just going to go premium instead🙏🏾
@SpotifyCares Ok,later. Thanks!👍
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/CoLMV9xixb

Should be "A Life in the Day of Benjamin André (Incomplete)"
@SpotifyCares Thanks, may be you can chek DM
@SpotifyCares But I really wish to experience this cool feature...... Anyway thanks for your prompt reply! You’re the best! https://t.co/yjiMUlak9E
@SpotifyCares Just disable it for non-premium users; I should be able to listen to playlists the way I'd prefer to.
I pay for that privilege.
@SpotifyCares As much as I appreciate the Spotify Studio recordings, I still just want my Rock This to be the top Spotify rock playlist that it used to be. Test things out in another station. And I know you guys hear the same for Rap Caviar. Just give us our music.
@SpotifyCares @736352 Whyyyyy ;(
@SpotifyCares @736352 Does anyone know WHEN it will be available???
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.1.1 happening over both and yeah it happens to downloaded tracks too
@SpotifyCares I've read Android phones *do* have a cache-clear function -- true or false?
@SpotifyCares Hmm, so is the iPhone issue an @115858 problem or a "Spotify is making money off the data somehow" problem? This isn't something new.
@SpotifyCares Alright cool! It was a killer playlist though. I know you guys will fix this in the next update.
@SpotifyCares App Version: 8.4.28.1104. Device: iPhone 7+. OS: iOS 11.1.2. Logging out/in didn’t help at all. 😔
@SpotifyCares Hi. Reinstalling the app worked. But I had to redownload my entire offline playlists. About 2,000+ songs. Lol. 😞
@SpotifyCares Love the service, beta test me anything.. iPhone 5s/6s Android++ and Blackberry keyone ✊🇨🇦
@SpotifyCares @736711 Amazingly still no reply to my issue???
@SpotifyCares The most frustrating thing is i don't want to leave spoitfy but the level of concern gor my issue is putting me right off. Very ungapoy right now i use spotify daily and the free is no good to me...
@SpotifyCares Skip Hiatt- __email__
@SpotifyCares Good morning! It's a Macbook Pro running OSX Sierra 10.12.6. Spotify version is 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3 (latest one I think).
@SpotifyCares I've tried logging out of Spotify and back in, and it didn't work. I'll try restarting my Mac at lunch break since I'm currently at work 🙈
@SpotifyCares Did a full reinstall and still not working. I’ll try to restart my Mac a little later but I doubt it will make a difference...
@SpotifyCares Restarted my Mac and it didn't work. I have the same problem on my phone (iPhone 6s, Spotify version 8.4.28).
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Trying to change payment method, but I have an ongoing support errand. I just tried changing the card validity year to 2046 (because the real year isn't accepted), and I got this extremely vague error message.
@SpotifyCares Tried it, doesn't work.
@SpotifyCares Hi Bot. Thanks for the link from 2012.
@SpotifyCares done! thanks for the reply 😌
@SpotifyCares Taking features away will only make it easier for users to go. I’ve been a premium user for 4+ years... don’t let me leave.
@SpotifyCares @115888 I love the app, but I don’t want to be charged TWICE every month!! This is insane!!
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/GmukdfXxbU
@SpotifyCares Iphone
@SpotifyCares THANK YOU
@SpotifyCares I fixed it &amp; got my spotify student subscription back but it won't let me reactivate my hulu subscription 🙃 the page won't load
@SpotifyCares Thanks @SpotifyCares you're my only friend
@SpotifyCares Please don't leave me.
@SpotifyCares I just got an email saying it was a receipt. I still haven't been able to listen to a single song. What screen shots am I supposed to get again? I if I find I have been billed again to be correct with an UNUSABLE DESTROYED ACCOUNT. THEN I'VE HAD ENOUGH
@SpotifyCares Why can't I pay subscription via mobile payment? There's just no option for that https://t.co/gmc8TORVJ3
@SpotifyCares Alright. (:
@SpotifyCares where is RED VELVET - PERFECT VELVET?!
@SpotifyCares ):
@SpotifyCares When reputation by taylor swift will be out on spotify😭
@SpotifyCares fuk u
@SpotifyCares She's going to check the repeat function more carefully later ☺
@SpotifyCares if i may know, what taking it so long? it has been 8 hours since the album released but it still can't be found in spotify
@SpotifyCares indonesia!
@SpotifyCares ah yes, but i search for their new album called perfect velvet
@SpotifyCares Can i ask when it will be released here in philippines? :—( Most of us wants to listen to it already and it had been 3 hours since it was released
@SpotifyCares Yes please!!! Badly need to listen and dl it asap 😭
@SpotifyCares Absolutely fantastic 😁 thank you! My premium subscription has been renewed! https://t.co/UG2IOlhpLA
@SpotifyCares Y'all better or Imma pop tf off
@SpotifyCares I can't help it. Please push her hard. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Hi! It was appreciating the behavior, in case it was not clear. ❤️
@SpotifyCares When will it be out tho 😭 I need a date
@SpotifyCares Hi! I’d like to edit or erase some of the Daily Mix playlists as they are rubbish. When googling, it doesn’t seem possible. Erasing the artist to never be played again doesn’t work either.. they keep on returning. Can you guide me how to fix this?
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your reply even if there isn’t a solution yet.
@SpotifyCares macOS (Sierra, 10.12.6), iPhone X, Spotify iOS (8.4.28.1104) / Spotify macOS 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares That also doesn't work. The playlist itself does sync to the iPhone, claiming the 8 particular songs are in there. Opening the playlist then shows a "Want to add songs to this playlist?" screen. Nor does it work in an existent playlist.
@SpotifyCares It should be Taiwan~ thank you😊
@SpotifyCares Awww I know that but I mean the newest album twicetagram isn’t on it😢
@SpotifyCares Okay. Thank you so much🙂hope to see their album on Spotify as soon as possible!
@SpotifyCares It was for ‘Go Compare’. I believe it was the latest version of the app. 8.4.28 and on iOS 11.2
@SpotifyCares Oh it’s ok I just deleted and reinstalled the app and it’s alright now thanks for replying though!
@SpotifyCares It seems random when it resets, but it happens a lot. Not every time I restart, but perhaps every time Spotify is upgraded?
@SpotifyCares - MacBook Pro Retina Mid 2012
- macOS 10.12.6
- Spotify 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares @739299 When will we have it?
@SpotifyCares I got switched from a rock playlist to a korean pop. I didnt mind, it was strange though. Not big deal. Thanks for reaching out.
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much for really caring! 🎀💓
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I just wanted to know if can see who is following one of my playlists, and if so where? I see the “X followers” notification in the upper right corner. But can’t see who it is. I’m on Mac btw.
@SpotifyCares Understood. Do you know if this is something Spotify is working on?
@SpotifyCares It's a Haivision IPTV network serving a few thousand users.
@SpotifyCares Wilco. Thanks for the clarification, LM.
@SpotifyCares Can't vote on it, Status Update there implies the "internal teams" don't really care to implement it. Shame, another thing Deezer is superior at.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/fLCxPMWDFf
@SpotifyCares S7 android atnt https://t.co/NNZMxvCAK7
@SpotifyCares It only happens on my s7  . At&amp;t mobile data . Charter spectrum wifi.  When trying to add music to a playlist when trying to search for a song or artist. This has occurred for months.  I only get what I search for Instantly on rare occasions. Laptop searches almost no issue
@SpotifyCares Windows 10, all the latest updates and drivers installed. Latest version of spotify as far as Im aware 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3 - it updated a day or two ago
@SpotifyCares It's always done it, even after multiple updates!
@SpotifyCares It says No 🤷‍♂️
@SpotifyCares The play button on the left hand side of the playlist on the desktop app. #itsthesmallthings https://t.co/RCp3iMb2Wu
@SpotifyCares Do you know why?
@SpotifyCares Lame I guess 😒😒
@SpotifyCares A good few, probs around 10,000
@SpotifyCares Blimey, that’s madness @115948 ‘s limit is 100,000 I believe? You should definitely raise it, 10,000 is nowt.
@SpotifyCares I can't see their new album at all. Singapore
@SpotifyCares nope, it's this. Clicked on the Spotify link but brings me to the app with an endless loading circle https://t.co/AdvMA4kdVi
@SpotifyCares Read the tweets?
@SpotifyCares Lol no
@SpotifyCares thanks, i will wait for it
@SpotifyCares It normally doesnt and no its happening when im offline usually
@SpotifyCares Samsung Galaxy J3 - Android 5.1.1 https://t.co/9XwkX9knmG
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the info
@SpotifyCares Ya, no none of those apply I already read through all of them but thanks. Any other ideas. This isn’t the first time it has happened.
@SpotifyCares Well this has happened with every iPhone I have owned since I’ve had Spotify
@SpotifyCares Hi, the email response seems to have stalled... is someone going to carry on helping me?
@SpotifyCares So they will be available soon or not?
@SpotifyCares I'm using the latest version in my app store: 8.4.28
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I'm using a MacBook Air with OS X Yosemite. No idea what version of Spotify (1.0.67.582.g19436fa3 ?). Randomly pauses and I have to manually press play button each time.
@SpotifyCares I'm already redownloading my tracks so if it happens again I will.
@SpotifyCares Okay, Thank you
@SpotifyCares @115888
@SpotifyCares thank you!
@SpotifyCares hi how do i stop spotify starting up on my computer automatically?
@SpotifyCares ok thank you
still having this issue and I know I'm not alone. Any ideas, @SpotifyCares ? I was in a meeting yesterday and OutKast unpaused randomly
@SpotifyCares Everything’s fine!
@SpotifyCares I've been trying that. I even follow, and unfollow, saved, and unsaved a track.
@SpotifyCares I've tried that, I've even tried doing that from the computer.
@SpotifyCares I've deleted the app from my computer, and phone. I downloaded the app back to my phone, and logged back on. Gabriel Iglesias is still there with 0 songs without being followed.
@SpotifyCares Just the Spotify app on my iPhone over WiFi. This issue seems to have just started this week.
@SpotifyCares Also just noticed that I don’t have the latest version of the app. Updating now and will let you know. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Also, I am from Holland and there is a special deal for Students, the price for premium month is 5 euro. I pay 10 euro each month. Can I change it? And can I link my ideal for it? Because they only accept Creditcard for it..
@SpotifyCares It’s lowkey crazy, because Holland never pays with credit cards, everyone uses iDeal, most of them are students like me.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I’ll do my best to wait!
@SpotifyCares I have a Samsung as a phone, and I would like to download the video of the video to my phone
@SpotifyCares No I'm looking to download the video @116130 send me by tweet onto my mobile device
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/W3nDK0EjhD
@SpotifyCares I have another question
@SpotifyCares Could you please dm me
@SpotifyCares I dmed you
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the help!
@SpotifyCares could u help me with that?
@SpotifyCares all done !
@SpotifyCares I did a search here on Twitter, and it seems i’m not the only one with this problem. Might want to consider an update to prevent this.
@SpotifyCares Perfect! Thanks anyway guys ❤️
@SpotifyCares IDK Spotify version
@SpotifyCares Thanks you won’t regret my idea
@SpotifyCares thanks! hope is ok now!
@SpotifyCares perfect velvet by red velvet!!!
@SpotifyCares ok thank u!!!
@SpotifyCares Ahh ok maybe add a filter or a way to remove it then makes sense a recommender system :)
@SpotifyCares Yes I took those steps. I hope it is over now, if not - like some of the cases described here: https://t.co/LImbiH04Km - i will report back.
@SpotifyCares It's now working on my mobile, but the desktop app still isn't
@SpotifyCares Desktop OS - Windows 7
Desktop version - 1.0.67.582g19436fa3
Mobile - Galaxy S8 
Mobile version - 8.4.26.770 armV7
@SpotifyCares I need help with verifying my school &amp; payment and I’m not putting my business twitter soooooooooooo
@SpotifyCares Haha would just help save my lazy butt googling something :P 

Cheers
@SpotifyCares No problem, thank you! Would be a nice feature to have, especially if you're tidying your room (like I am now...) :P
@SpotifyCares i live in the netherlands
@SpotifyCares My spotify premium thing just stopped working
@SpotifyCares Alrighhhhhhthyyyg but i neeeded it yesterday
@SpotifyCares I appreciate the reply. I’ve been listening to a lot of Odesza songs recently because I went to their concert. Seems odd to go from that to hardcore punk and screamo.
@SpotifyCares Okay, but it's been like this for a long couple months now? Hope it's gets fixed soon. I've this issue in other Twitter post as well. This keeps popping up every time I try and log in. Event tried on my phone just now, same exact thing. https://t.co/BGvZ4ookhD
@SpotifyCares I sent a DM with the details
@SpotifyCares Why is your community so circular in its form ?? Every and it seemed as if it was every click brought you back to the forum !! I’m using IMac with iPad and iPhone .. KT
@SpotifyCares thank u for the quick response! Spotify does care! haha
@SpotifyCares Yeah, but I️ use Spotify about 5 hours a day during the week. Is that not enough?
@SpotifyCares @115888 @117153 ❤️
@SpotifyCares Okay! Why i can't buy Spotify Premium with iTunes?
I just have iTunes! Can fix it? Answer me back!

Thanks for your time, have a Nice day!
@SpotifyCares yup, I’ve tried to logout, restart, login.. I’ve tried to uninstall and reinstall https://t.co/1ipu4kYSn8 and nothing is changed.
@SpotifyCares yes, I’ve deleted the folder.
@SpotifyCares No worries! I just followed all of my old playlists, create copies and added the same songs to them. Easy Peazy. Thank you! Love you lots!
@SpotifyCares I did it already, cmon i have been waiting waiting and waiting...
@SpotifyCares Got that, I'm speaking of the Playlists list on the left side of the screen, not after I've selected one
@SpotifyCares Thanks I know I'm not alone👍👍👍
@SpotifyCares Worked, thx
@SpotifyCares Bummer. Thanks anyway.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/atnDfoBdbg
@SpotifyCares yes still white cover
@SpotifyCares dont you have like an account cache in your servers to clean or reset before i have to uninstall and re-download over a 1000 songs
@SpotifyCares yes I've tried everything. I'll just have to wait then
@SpotifyCares what is going on with this album cover? i thought it was my phone but no https://t.co/TTMzfBFURm
@SpotifyCares Yo - you guys tell me to go DM... then donʻt reply.... what gives?
@SpotifyCares Actually I just found it out, but thanks anyways
@SpotifyCares Yo, I can't thank you guys enough. i know me asking for it probably wasn't the catalyst but I'm just so happy to finally have  DMXs version of Rudolph 🙌🏾🙏🏾
@SpotifyCares why isnt it all the first one… it looks way better! 😏
@SpotifyCares Hi i only use Spotify on my laptop which is a windows 10 and I think the image here might show the version I use https://t.co/Liq5ydYuNY
@SpotifyCares Brilliant works perfectly thanks for all your help
@SpotifyCares Thanks 👍🏼
@SpotifyCares Thanks my doggies
@SpotifyCares Android. If the app has been closed, it doesn't have a now playing so no way to connect to a device until something is playing
@SpotifyCares Yes, Oreo and always update apps
@SpotifyCares Ah, I see that now. Didn't think to look in settings since I've always used the link under the song title. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares @744672 I had the same issue but all my songs got deleted and I can't re-download..
@SpotifyCares Only my saved songs, I don't have any downloaded songs on my account anymore. Every artists on my saved lists used to have full albums saved and now there's only about 1/4 and I have to re-add the music
@SpotifyCares My version is 8.4.26.770
@SpotifyCares It worked thank you very much for the assistance!!!!
@SpotifyCares Thanks, homies.
@SpotifyCares Thanks DF!
@SpotifyCares It’s weird as it was working fine in the last weeks. Also I’m not a new user I have a pretty huge Library with tons of tracks.
@SpotifyCares Just did that didn’t fix it 😕
@SpotifyCares Happening on all. 3g/4g and WiFi
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+, iOS 11.1, I️ just updated Spotify yesterday
@SpotifyCares Thx, but that's not it. If I play 1 song in a collection, the 2nd song will always be from a previous playlist I used to listen to. I listen to @15883 and then the next song is Blondie or Pet Shop Boys from an 80s playlist I have instead of the next Tyler track...
@SpotifyCares Yep, fixed 👌
@SpotifyCares Thanks to your excellent support agent (Shirley D!) I’ve already been taken care of. Thanks for the concern @SpotifyCares my account is returned and restored!
@SpotifyCares thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thanks so much! I've been trying to solve this for over a year and my debut EP is coming out soon!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply, much appreciated &amp; I ❤️@115888 - There are 9,968 people who went to the trouble of voting for this since 2012. How many do you need to action it? @147836 https://t.co/BMSdgjng9v
@SpotifyCares Al right, thanks for the reply!

@SpotifyCares thank you :)
@SpotifyCares Well, high hopes from you guys.
@SpotifyCares Excellent thanks
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks!
@SpotifyCares Seems to be fine using Firefox
@SpotifyCares The problem does still happen using incognito mode in Chrome
@SpotifyCares Sure thing. Checked Chrome on a different computer and it seemed to be working fine there.
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Yeah thanks for the non-answer and disregard. I've spent a decade building my library now I'll have to seriously consider Apple.
@SpotifyCares Yeah I've already read that crap. It's obvious your company doesn't care. The older y'all get, the more libraries will grow.
@SpotifyCares Until y'all fix it, I'm out.
@SpotifyCares Never mind, just checked and it's on there! Thanks!!
@SpotifyCares @746466 I added my email 3 years ago. FOH
@SpotifyCares Ghana
@SpotifyCares I’ve sent you a message and you’re not still responding
@SpotifyCares I’m on the latest version updated for iPhone X. These issues were present prior to the update for me as well.
@SpotifyCares The latest version of everything. Your forums are full of people with the same problem and have been for months and months and months.
Sometimes doesn't play at all, other times broken audio or double speed audio. Apple music works perfectly. Go figure
@SpotifyCares No worries!
@SpotifyCares Srry my artist profile and songs
@SpotifyCares Ummmmmmmm you fixed it! I never even thought of restarting it. 😐 thanks for your help! 😁
@SpotifyCares So I just installed the latest version on to my Mac desktop. That’s when it stopped doing it 😐
@SpotifyCares Do you guys know when it will be available?
@SpotifyCares you offered me the 30 day free trial and then tried to charge me lol
@SpotifyCares I’m using mifi. I have reset it but still.
@SpotifyCares Here the app version https://t.co/aoWeQl43EW
@SpotifyCares I have upgraded the spotify till the latest ver for both iphone and windows 8.
@SpotifyCares Oh okay. I wish it would just play my playlist. Thanks though.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/xnJjs6J2WG
@SpotifyCares The Playlist already has a few hundred songs and I'm pretty sure the song that was suggested is in it.
@SpotifyCares BTW, excellent UI for suggestions. So easy to use.
@SpotifyCares Done and done. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares My Spotify detects a device in another state. Does this mean that person is using my account?
@SpotifyCares Ohhhh found it!! Thank you, @SpotifyCares!!
@SpotifyCares Hi! Thanks for the reply! Issue was resolved with someone through the chat function on your website!
@SpotifyCares Thank you again!
@SpotifyCares Done. Thank you. In the meantime, I also have a suggestion that might help those like me with this problem: I'd love to see a way to alphabetize my "All Songs" category on the app so I can easily eliminate duplicate songs to allow for more space.
@SpotifyCares United States homie
@SpotifyCares Pops on all my wireless equipment. I run Windows 10 where the issue is most common. Xbox One poor sound. Windows 7 no issue.
@SpotifyCares nevermind, looks like after i updated to the latest version i can see the option available. I had a beta version previously.
@SpotifyCares I think you don’t lauch your app in #india
@SpotifyCares Last time and this time your answer will be same 😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬
@SpotifyCares Makes sense. Thank you! 🙏🏼
@SpotifyCares It is, thanks! Chrome had issues, but Firefox worked.
@SpotifyCares Worked through a different browser!
@SpotifyCares "Submitted 2012"

This doesn't exactly inspire confidence
these happened when i was asleep because if @SpotifyCares has a sleep timer, i don't know where it is
@SpotifyCares "You've downloaded music to more than 3 devices"
Will this still be an issue if i have a premium family account?
@SpotifyCares grazie!
@SpotifyCares yes! actually, restarting removed the glitch of the app. i hope this would not happen again. thanks for your concern.
@SpotifyCares Device: Samsung Galaxy E7

@SpotifyCares Thanks for this information. I'm now trying to play music on the tv via Spotify Connect on my phone but the tv isn't popping up as a device? My phone also says download Spotify app to the tv but that link you provided says I don't have to?
@SpotifyCares That doesn’t explain why it’s so terrible
@SpotifyCares Nope
@SpotifyCares Spotify v8.4.28.1104 / iPhone X / iOS 11.2 beta. Hardware volume controls on the phone don’t work for controlling volume when playing through connect device. Works ok when playing audio on the phone itself. Assume 11.2 beta bug? - one to be aware of though. 🤞🏻
@SpotifyCares S”ok - updated to iOS 11.2 beta 4 and hardware volume control seems to be working now. I’ll let you know if it breaks again. Cheers.
@SpotifyCares I have tried uninstalling the app and turning my phone off and on.Is there any way you guys can please fix it? This is the only issue I have
@SpotifyCares I was going to just transfer my songs from the old playlist to the new one but it doesn't show my song list when I choose a playlist
@SpotifyCares My android is samsung galaxy s7 and the spotify version I have is 8.4.25.771armv7
@SpotifyCares Will check, thanks.
@SpotifyCares Are you single?
@SpotifyCares iOS 11.0.1 and Spotify 8.4.22
@SpotifyCares nope, it still does that. should i update my iOS and Spotify, perhaps?
@SpotifyCares okay, i’ll give it a try, thank you 😁
@SpotifyCares Wow that was easy! Thanks. So I've been scrolling since I joined up in 2010... Stupid.
@SpotifyCares It would be more convienent if the latest additions to a playlist showed up at the top of the list. Save us an AWFUL lot of scrolling.
@SpotifyCares Far as I can tell it's possible to sort by date but then only have the option of latest songs showing up at the bottom. Can I reverse it?
@SpotifyCares Ahh okay. Thank you 😊
@SpotifyCares Hahahahaha its all good
@SpotifyCares You would have thought you could have told me "oh this looks weird ,your password has been reset from the Philippines + used on new device"
@SpotifyCares Please do!
@SpotifyCares i always get this msg after entering the pin. https://t.co/tm6qMTsUHo
@SpotifyCares Thank you, I know that it’s something a lot of people would like too, there was even a petition started somewhere! X
@SpotifyCares version 8.4.26.793
@SpotifyCares I already visited that page but I couldn't find anything for an email address that has been changed, just passwords changes :( is there a specific section I should be looking in?
@SpotifyCares Thank you :)
@SpotifyCares I am worried because our bank account details are linked to the account. Can forward the email if you like - it shows the email address it has been changed to but it was an unauthorised change
@SpotifyCares Cool, thanks!
@SpotifyCares I have an iPhone 7s and have updated my Spotify. Also my Sonos. Am using Spotify via Sonos.
@SpotifyCares I get an error that says Spotify tracks are unable to play. It tries to skip to next track. Same thing.
@SpotifyCares Very good work so far Spotify
@SpotifyCares people who practice music should be the ones doing the analyzing. Theories about music from non-practitioners is harmful to us
@SpotifyCares Thanks y'all! You're the best as always!
@SpotifyCares Seems to be 👍
@SpotifyCares Thanks! A Moto G Play, running Android 6.0.1, Spotify v 8.4.26.770 armV7.
@SpotifyCares @751971 You see this kind of care @751971? Good luck getting this with YouTubeRed or Tidal.
@SpotifyCares Hey now that you mention it, can you do everything in your power to get the song "Otis" by Kanye and Jay back on Spotify? It's a real banger
@SpotifyCares It’s ok. Turns out Spotify needed an update too 👍👍
@SpotifyCares Just checked and it's up now.. cheers for the help tho
@SpotifyCares Just mentioned that your service wanted me to input my credit card information after couple of months having student discount, no discount.
@SpotifyCares Nothing happens when I press play. Eveything looks completely as usual, except no matter what song I press play on, it doesn’t play. It does get listed as “recently played” though.
@SpotifyCares It’s still the same :-/
@SpotifyCares Logging out and in didn’t work. Restarting the device isn’t an option right now.
@SpotifyCares I was able to restart, and that fixed it 👍🏻
@SpotifyCares PC, Windows. I'll check phone when I'm driving in a second and the album I've noticed it on today is Common Courtesy by A Day To Remember. Dead &amp; Buried is significantly louder than Violence (Enough is Enough). You can really tell with the bass drops in them.
@SpotifyCares It seems fine on my phone. I'll make sure everything is updated on PC and if it doesn't fix it I'll uninstall &amp; reinstall to see if that fixes it and report back to ya'll. I thought it might have something to do with when you guys reduced the loudness playback a couple months ago
@SpotifyCares The problem seems to be that my monitors have different resolutions. #1: 1920x1080; #2: 1600x1200. The window size is limited to the resolution of the screen it opened on. So, if I move it from #1 to #2, the bottom 120px of the window are transparent.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 11.0.3, Spotify 8.4.25. My car is a Mercedes-Benz A200
@SpotifyCares I’m going to to do and see what happens.... if not works I’ll writing to you again. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Perfect everything works normally again. Thanks for your help
@SpotifyCares Thank you Spotify love you guys
@SpotifyCares Ahh Spotify Cares appreciate it
@SpotifyCares No that doesn’t help at all.
@SpotifyCares Yeah but it won't seem to let me update my payment info without the NUS number?
@SpotifyCares Spotify 8.4.27.895
iOS 11.2
@SpotifyCares Yep, still happening.
@SpotifyCares No dice. Same problems.
@SpotifyCares 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02 macOS
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/JohbNV4r7L
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/cHmu6KmeCK
@SpotifyCares it is working now but earlier it wasn’t, thanks, the product &amp; tech team should be aware of this though
@SpotifyCares Sure! https://t.co/7IJFxjO2AG
@SpotifyCares I just tried it on a different PC that I have Spotify installed on -same thing happened!
Can't you guys tell the difference between Soul and Funk? :P
@SpotifyCares It's not the track art- when I click on Redbone's 'come and get your love' -Gloria Gaynor's 'I will survive' plays instead
@SpotifyCares It’s the most up to date version I believe https://t.co/UdRKMe6Ocy
@SpotifyCares Nope - still has same issue - So I play music, switch to YouTube App, start watching a video, that takes over the speakers (as it should), switch back to Spotify and press play, it suggests it is playing but nothing comes out.
@SpotifyCares Doesn’t work - Did the same as before and go back into the app and it thinks it is still playing music but it has been stopped by the video
@SpotifyCares it’s an album by lil peep
@SpotifyCares Thank you ☺️
@SpotifyCares Sent a DM dudes. Changed my password now.
@SpotifyCares I don’t know any of this. I’m using my iPad and it’s probably the most updated version.
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/3tjNYbHuEr Google Chrome, MacBook Pro
@SpotifyCares Just for Chris Brown’s albums. And yep I’ll get it now
@SpotifyCares iPhone iOS 11.1.2. After it closed so many times it finally opened up.
@SpotifyCares I believe it’s fine now. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Oh look what I just found. So another  company saw a problem and created a solution. That's supposed to be what you do. I don't want to buy this, I want this on my watch. https://t.co/ak3AEOqBz2
@SpotifyCares it’s been over 2 months 🤧
@SpotifyCares Will get back to you
@SpotifyCares Thanks :)
@SpotifyCares Yooo!!! You rock 🤘 https://t.co/KrNfhqGQWw
@SpotifyCares Now that’s service! https://t.co/OMxOT0F9z3
@SpotifyCares Does that mean I can't tailor the adverts then?
@SpotifyCares Whenever I try to use it on my laptop, it’s so slow and take forever to load.
@SpotifyCares Can you help me out? I tried signing in to an account and that worked. But I want to get my own account so I can get Spotify Premium for Students.
@SpotifyCares thank you!!!
@SpotifyCares It works on my computer &amp; but not my phone
@SpotifyCares Still not working but I'm just not gonna worry about it anymore. Thanks for trying to help
@SpotifyCares The surprise was that the song WASN'T on the "Christmas in Canada" playlist. 😭 But luckily I can add it to my own playlist.
@SpotifyCares Thanks so much! ☕️☕️
@SpotifyCares I managed to work it out!! 🙊 thank you though x
@SpotifyCares It’s a screenshot of the search term ‘Spotify Apple Watch’ trending number 1 in the Watch App Store, yet still no app. Pathetic.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. Now I can see that the second language on my phone - after Danish - was Spanish. I’ve changed it to English now 😊
@SpotifyCares Everything is updated to the newest update ffs
@SpotifyCares Nope? Y'all releasing demons and shit in my house? I've restarted and just deleted and reinstalled the app. No change!
@SpotifyCares Hey. Thanks for the reply, those are the albums to be removed! My artist profile is: https://t.co/NadIVCD1Yx
@SpotifyCares Huawei TIT-L01, Android 5.1. Spotify version 8.4.28.875. I removed the app and reinstalled it and that fixed the problem. We'll see how long this works. 😝
@SpotifyCares It doesn’t happen with all notifications it seems to be when I get Snapchat notifications and I’ve checked my settings and they are fine
@SpotifyCares I’ll try that now
@SpotifyCares iPhone model SE and on the latest iOS , Spotify premium family and this happens whenever I play music whether it’s through aux, Bluetooth or through the phone speakers
@SpotifyCares @115888 It’s on an apple phone
@SpotifyCares Thank you for replying so quickly! Have now successfully invited. Ended up using my phone to do it, still not working on the laptop web version though so not sure what’s wrong there
@SpotifyCares I haven't got an account yet. I'm interested to starting on the premium accounts up!
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your help.

Much appreciated 🙃
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+, latest version- every time I get a notification on Snapchat , even if I don’t have the app open, it pauses my music playing in the Spotify app.
@SpotifyCares No error messages; Spotify literally just pauses when Snapchat goes off; I have to go back into the app and hit play again. This is happening to my friends too
@SpotifyCares Haven’t tried re logging; I’ll try that now. Restarting however doesn’t work. I’m not sure if it’s you guys or apple because all of my friends that didn’t update to iOS 11 don’t have this problem; all the ones that did update do have the problem.🤔
@SpotifyCares Okay I reinstalled it and now everything is working again
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares yeah that worked, should have done that initially. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Two albums actually. "Laced" and "Bleed the Sky" by Reveille. I know the label (@96402)
@SpotifyCares That shows me mostly artists I don't listen to or haven't heard of. Any way to subscribe to specific artists so I know when they release stuff?
@SpotifyCares yeah this is extremely not the very simple thing that I need
@SpotifyCares Spotify premium
@SpotifyCares It works!
@SpotifyCares Oh okay thank you
@SpotifyCares This is the song that was not playing correctly but it seems to be working fine now! https://t.co/xLTWj1xbYa
@SpotifyCares Yup! Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Zte x grand. Android 6.0.1
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/bJJiG2BmYn
@SpotifyCares Got it figured out. It spawned from my everyday premium SFY account being a variant of my normal because my normal email account is now forever req'd to be linked to FB apparently.
@SpotifyCares Latest version. iPhone X
@SpotifyCares No error messages. It’s simply not changing songs once the previous one finishes
@SpotifyCares 11.1.2 and the newest Spotify update
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I understand the inherent idea of trying to match files to existing catalogue—it improves offline capability and it provides play data. But it’s 100% wrong when I have conflicting ID3 tags on my files.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6 ios11.1.1 latest Spotify app
@SpotifyCares I'll add that its for my partner and I, so we share the same address etc.
@SpotifyCares That's awesome. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I checked. The setting isn’t there.
@SpotifyCares Apple iPhone 7plus. Version 8.4.28 and using iOS 11.
@SpotifyCares I like early 2000s and emo music. Thank you for caring 💖
@SpotifyCares Omg???? It's perfect. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thanks but you haven’t read my tweet and jumped straight into stock answer mode. The labels have put albums online intended for the UK market and then blocked them in the country they are intended for. You’ve gotta admit that seems odd?
@SpotifyCares I don’t think you do. Why would a UK label upload an album for the UK market and then block in the UK if there was a licensing issue? It’s clearly errors. Alisha’s Attic’s 1st&amp;3rd albums are on but the 2nd is on but blocked. All the same label. Can’t be a licensing issue! Thanks.
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares So and that's it right? You guys didn't even try to  give an adequate answer to your subscribers for 2 days? You guys really suck. Me and my friends are switching to SoundCloud.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your response! I went to @115858 and they fixed it for me- it was a problem with my iPhone. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Yes! I will keep my subscription :) thank you
@SpotifyCares Just uninstalled and reinstalled the app, everything is back but now I gotta download it all again
@SpotifyCares It's still showing all the artists I downloaded, but they all show 0 songs
@SpotifyCares Amazing!
@SpotifyCares Hmmm, my word selection was bad. What I mean is that the recommendations I got the last few months are never for songs I enjoy.
@SpotifyCares I have an acer laptop running on Windows 10 fall creators and my Spotify version is the 1.66.478.0
@SpotifyCares I did and my computer freezed, is there something else I can do ?
@SpotifyCares Nope, only on my laptop which is where I use Spotify the most
@SpotifyCares Thank you! I reset my phone and they were all back
@SpotifyCares Hey we actually figured it out! Thank you though. Premium subscription account cancellation didn’t go through on one account. Thanks though
@SpotifyCares Desktop/Win7/1.0.67.582.g19436fa3, and it's not a bug or anything, just due to the live search. I'd just prefer an option to not be taken to the 'recent searches' page when clicking on/clearing the search bar
@SpotifyCares I am on Android.
@SpotifyCares spotify:album:3mVoorEXaZW9KoTZvBNcrH
@SpotifyCares No
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares Thanks MT. Really looking forward to options to turn off pictures of Drake and disable Drake pictures!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s, iOS 11.2, Spotify 8.4.27.895

Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Lol the repeat option was on. Nice catch.

Thanks! Back to the radio stations 👌🙌
@SpotifyCares Spotify Free. Installed on 19th March 2016.
@SpotifyCares It's happened every time I've checked in the past few months. Have restarted my router a handful of times during this period. Should I try uninstalling, then reinstalling?
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your response! I ended up deleting and reinstalling the @115888 App. Much appreciated! #CustomerService #spotifyfansfirst
@SpotifyCares All is working properly now! Thanks again. I must say, I tried to give @129941 an opportunity to win me back but I'm glad I stuck with @115888. Keep up the good work!
@SpotifyCares Thx you babe
@SpotifyCares Yes, I found that one -- do you have a link to the old one? Bit sad you deleted it.
@SpotifyCares You said that last time https://t.co/8iaJQzeT0R
@SpotifyCares It's a Win7 PC, version is 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares Seems to be working now, thanks.
@SpotifyCares Currently using  Dell Inspiron 15 3000 series running windows 10 and spotify version (see attached image) https://t.co/G2Lofa98zU
@SpotifyCares ive done most the steps you would ask, plus its not bothering me at all.
@SpotifyCares Tried my android and iPad but nothing happend
@SpotifyCares Nice password, tried and doesn't affect me
@SpotifyCares nothing happens, nice password though
@SpotifyCares I apologize for the confusion.  I already have the web player downloaded.  What I mean is there used to be add ons/apps within the app.  One I recall was Pitchfork.  I don't see them anymore.

I'm trying to find ways to find music in other countries
@SpotifyCares What do you mean?
@SpotifyCares It happens on my xbox and samsung s7 edge and it should be the latest version of the app i tried a test account you gave me last time i said about the glitch and the same thing happened
@SpotifyCares macOS 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
though, this is simply a product-at-large suggestion :)
cc: @117168
@SpotifyCares Available on iOS? soon? 🙃
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares took care of my very lengthy issue. Very professional and nice to see someone actually believes in great customer service! 😀😀😀
@SpotifyCares Thanks for getting back to me. I tried logging in on a different iOS device and got the same message, and the message also appears when logging in with just my username + password instead of email + password.
@SpotifyCares @763443 He meant "So is it 0.99€ or 9.99€" as a joke
@SpotifyCares Guys that's all? Copied answer? Here we are waiting for Spotify launching for years and it's never happens. Im really sorry but its sucks! https://t.co/kioLoMzLzy
@SpotifyCares So the same answer I got last year! #stillwaitingtoseethesedeals #gettingfedupofputtingnewsuscribersfirst
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Tried reinstalling the latest version available. The issue persisted.
@SpotifyCares Cannot log out, because I cannot open the app... It just relaunches constantly. Already deleted all the data in the Library folder —cache and support—, so a new install ought to be logged out; but the problem persists...
@SpotifyCares Didn’t have a chance to restart the computer yet —just logging out doesn’t help either—, and I suspect it’s not an option to restart the Wi-Fi at work ;) Will try doing both at home later today...
@SpotifyCares Yay! Deleting caches again and restarting the computer did the trick.  Thanks for your time and help! :)
@SpotifyCares @764074 It's very possible, just no one implements it. Low on the priority list, I imagine.
@SpotifyCares I will see, once I'm home from work, if I can recreate the issue with changing auto pay methods and get you a screenshot
@SpotifyCares Its a Window10 PC, I've tried everything, forums, the lot, now considering ditching my subscription
@SpotifyCares The main Premium for Family account is __email__ , which is mine. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I didn't get a DM 😕 can u please send it now??
@SpotifyCares It keeps saying my email account is not associated with the account but yet this is where the emails come
@SpotifyCares The latter. Has done for some but not for others.
@SpotifyCares Can I/Spotify change it with more readable username? Hopefully i can change it,
By the way my name is Daeng not Deang (:
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks, hopefully in the future Spotify can provide option to change the auto-generated username that created through Facebook with editable username.
Thanks for the support Spotify! 
Greeting from Indonesia 🇮🇩
@SpotifyCares Clearly I understand that your app can't be moved to the SD card. My point was that when I don't download the songs they are still downloading into your cache. So I have to clear your cache at least once a week because I run out of space on my phone
@SpotifyCares Android 6.0.1
Samsung galaxy J7
Spotify for Android latest ver
@SpotifyCares will try that out, thanks :)
@SpotifyCares it's already been taken care of. I found a way to send a form without signing in. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7+, iOS 11.1.2, and I just updated Spotify yesterday
@SpotifyCares No it’s hasn’t. I’ve tried it multiple times
@SpotifyCares Happens on WiFi and cellular
@SpotifyCares Greetings! Russian Federation
@SpotifyCares Already done, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Just because some in a group listen to a song doesn't make it appropriate to represent them, pick songs that show us, not songs about a straight couple who want flings with others.. thanks
@SpotifyCares Thank you.. just next pride put something in the list that is in someway prideful and a few being by gay artists would be nice too
@SpotifyCares Basically yesterdsy he Spotify mobile app proceeded to download a couple of hundred songs via 4g despite being set to WiFi only using up a big chunk of my data I'm not happy https://t.co/39u8wbtR9j
@SpotifyCares “we’ve decided not to offer” sounds like it’s only possible because of your decision. At the least a method to say “more like this/less like this”?
 
Some awful songs show up in the Daily Mix/Radio and it ruins my groove. 🙁
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/SUDCZBwH0w
@SpotifyCares Thanks!! :) here is the broken song. https://t.co/S2OsYphoVD
@SpotifyCares ios 11.1.2 The app was updated 2 days ago. Version 8.4.28
@SpotifyCares I am Premium.  Multiple albums.  It also happens when I hit the next song button.
@SpotifyCares No luck, still happening. When I play Spotify on my desk top computer the problem doesn't occur.
@SpotifyCares Not sure about that.
@SpotifyCares @146177 @115888 Thanks 😊😊😊
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Thanks.  It's a Samsung galaxy S6. Spotify is the most recent version
@SpotifyCares I know and I've uninstalled and reinstalled Spotify twice and nothing has solved the problem
@SpotifyCares It's over both Wi-Fi and mobile data and I 50g unlimited.
@SpotifyCares Yes I've tried that as well and it still does not work
@SpotifyCares Yes I know how that works but there is no download button above my songs list
@SpotifyCares Some are some aren't
@SpotifyCares That's not a pain in the ass at all
@SpotifyCares Yeah I get that. So where do I download them with the app on my computer these are the options I have https://t.co/el2ZdaRxhB
@SpotifyCares It’s an iPhone 7, 11.1 update, not sure how to tell what version Spotify is...  but there’s no queue button in the top corner anymore https://t.co/ost5uihoRs
@SpotifyCares Thank you ☺️Love your services!
@SpotifyCares Thanks, but none of these issues apply. Spotify used Sunday, app regularly updated via play store, not on other devices. Recently played items still show, no saved artists or albums just a few playlists. Help!
@SpotifyCares @766431 Try the latest version, it's working for me now.
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6S, iPhone 8 Plus, iPad Mini 2 all on ios 11 (has happened on all 11.x versions since release)
Thanks!
@SpotifyCares That doesn't fix anything. Happening across multiple devices after iOS 11, and on a brand new iPhone too :(
@SpotifyCares it’s ok it was a good throwback! also please hire me spotify is everything i love
@SpotifyCares Thanks. It's a shame. Maybe something you could consider. Or creating playlists without any explicit lyrics?
@SpotifyCares I’ve done those steps Is there no way of retrieving my playlists?!?
@SpotifyCares Sent the email address  few hours ago - any progress?
@SpotifyCares I'm on an MSI laptop running Windows 10 and spotify version 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares I didn't get a chance to reinstall but I checked on two other devices (my phone &amp; PC) and think I figured it out. If you search directly for the album, it's correct (https://t.co/FkL35W5T66 -&gt; https://t.co/8L81ukNYXK), but the artist page is wrong (https://t.co/itNnTnIsy7).
@SpotifyCares it's been a week
@SpotifyCares Y’all should apply to every playlist, it looks awesome. Specially on the iPhone X. Wow.
@SpotifyCares no. I was on a chat with Google and they made me wipe the computer. It seems to be a bug in the app
@SpotifyCares I am using Chrome OS on the Pixelbook. The App vesrion is 8.4.28.875 x86
@SpotifyCares Are there plans to support it?
@SpotifyCares 👀 I saw the help flying! Thanks, I've send this in a direct message.😍
@SpotifyCares Both and with no WiFi nor data on
@SpotifyCares On my pc it's running fine. Until last week I still had an android 4.1 system on my phone and that was happening as well
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Huawei G Play mini with an Android 5.1.1 and the app version is 8.4.26.770 armV7
@SpotifyCares Thanks, continue with the good job! Ill be waiting like the other thousands of portugueses! By the way if you have some extra premium account, im here to hear ;)
@SpotifyCares It's an album. I've listened to about 10 suggested songs and 2 from the album. Nvm. 😑
@SpotifyCares HI there - still getting the same message!
@SpotifyCares I’ll try that! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares THANKS 💃💃💃
@SpotifyCares Hi thanks! Is this https://t.co/E4gAVp1Lg2 to enter my account for spotify artists.
@SpotifyCares Already did that. With firefox and safari. It logs in ok, but when I select "Your Account" goes to that error page.
@SpotifyCares Will do
@SpotifyCares @92603 @115888 Oh okay thank you☺️
@SpotifyCares there’s no tweet button???
@SpotifyCares Thanks for your answer. What about podcast in other languages? Is that also in the works?
@SpotifyCares Done, thank you for the link!
@SpotifyCares I sent it to DM and I'm waiting for your help
@SpotifyCares Thank you very much for your time!! I'll do it and see if it starts to run smoothly again now
@SpotifyCares I just renewed. No issue, I just didn't know it was expiring and thought something was broken
@SpotifyCares iPhone7+, iOS11.1, Spotify 8.4.26.793 ; it fast forwards &amp; stops on its own just like what i have said awhile ago and if it does, all i can do is to exit the app and it works fine again... then it suddenly stops and fastworwards again &amp; again, thank you spotify for hearing me out
@SpotifyCares Okay why though
@SpotifyCares Apple Music doesn’t do that and my app runs fine :/
@SpotifyCares thanks sisters, i appreciate it 🤠
@SpotifyCares usa!
@SpotifyCares When I shuffle a playlist and I view the song queue it keeps showing the same 5 or 6 songs repeatedly instead of the other songs in the playlist.

I'm on OnePlus One running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.

(Also sometimes I can't add new songs to a playlist on iPad Pro iOS 11.1.2)
@SpotifyCares Didn't work. 

Also, y'all need an option to keep the quick controls in the notification panel even when I'm not in the app for a few minutes. If I still have a device playing Spotify the controls should stay, not time out.
@SpotifyCares The queue is still showing the same songs in a loop. Just to clarify, the playlist DOES play different songs, I just can't see the correct queue. But yeah if I could get a fix for that soon I'd appreciate. :)

And thanks for acknowledging the other thing as well. 👌
@SpotifyCares It's happening on any playlist and it's only on the phone. The correct queue shows on the iPad.
@SpotifyCares logged out of both devices, restarted the apps, logged back in, still out of sync (see pics) https://t.co/QtCxpjg8BR
@SpotifyCares hmph. re-installing the apps on desktop and iOS seems to have erased my played/unplayed/progress from iOS -- everything now appears as unplayed :(
@SpotifyCares and as far as i can tell, they're still out of sync (based on some initial tests just now)
@SpotifyCares when i️ did the reinstall step, they were both connected to wifi.
@SpotifyCares I’m using Spotify version 8.4.28 and ios 11.1.1  thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares cool cool cool I think I'm finally ready to switch to Apple Music
@SpotifyCares that's a shame.
@SpotifyCares I hated the whole playlist. Usually my daily mixes are way better than that
@SpotifyCares It didn't help
@SpotifyCares If Google can overcome these issues I will ditch alexa
@SpotifyCares How do I fix Spotify losing my multiple echos?
@SpotifyCares I've had my downloads removed twice before but this time I'm missing songs from my library
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/gYZi7jm1Yz
@SpotifyCares I can't find the old version of No Limit (without the extra verse) and I had it saved, but that song now has the extra verse.
@SpotifyCares Hello and thank you. Does this mean each monetary value gives usage for a different length of time ?
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much for your help. Have a good day. P.S. I'm addicted to my @115888 😀
@SpotifyCares Hello again, the voucher I'm thinking of buying is for a Christmas present for a friend so i want to surprise them.  I know it says on your site the voucher can be sent to a persons email address. Can I choose to have it delivered to my email address even though it's for a friend
@SpotifyCares I know you may not know exactly but any idea of a rough time frame of the wait.  I have cd but dont wanna pay for itunes when i already pay $10/for this. Love spotify.  All my songs on the go
@SpotifyCares Thank you for your help
@SpotifyCares Can tell you then over DM please ?
@SpotifyCares I can’t Import music from my computer like my local files won’t play on desktop Spotify also the local files playlist have only imported with all songs on my iPhone not iPod or iPad they won’t play
@SpotifyCares Bro, 2 hours late? Jeez you guys don't like your clients, Spotify don't really care.
@SpotifyCares Nah, there's nothing wrong.
Love you guys, please bring back the portuguese band "Comme Restus"
@SpotifyCares Yes I have tried that this has been going on for months
@SpotifyCares I'm connected on WiFi and it says no Internet connection.  But any other programs I open online are working properly. Everything is up to date and never had this issue before.
@SpotifyCares Samsung galaxy tablet all updated versions.
@SpotifyCares Nope
@SpotifyCares Yes it is.
@SpotifyCares I could be getting 3 months for 99c https://t.co/T3tTBbFXle
@SpotifyCares So it has to do with my account being reset recently? I have almost 50 playlists and probably thousands of songs saved. This has never happened before.
@SpotifyCares 2nd week in a row, no Discover Weekly. I listen to 300-600 songs a week, why did my account transfer initiate this new behavior?
@SpotifyCares Any insight to the updates coming? There’s just so much wrong with the app right now....
@SpotifyCares If you’re gonna drastically change things at least give us a walk through so we know how things work and where you moved things to. But right now I can’t search for an artist or find any of my saved playlists or my curated “radio stations”
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares So all of my playlists are there, and when I go into “my artists” the only artists that show up are the ones I’m “following” all of the songs and artists and albums I’ve saved and downloaded are gone
@SpotifyCares My app JUST updated this weekend. I only have two devices I listen on, my computer and my phone.
@SpotifyCares hmm, they're back. I restarted my iOS app and they appeared. I did see them on my Android, too. here's what it looked like, fyi - best, joe https://t.co/0FrC3GLR4h
@SpotifyCares looks good. thank you, CH.
@SpotifyCares 11.1.2
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6 iOS 11 non premium
@SpotifyCares Working now. I’ll report if it acts up again
@SpotifyCares I just purchased 3-months premium support and it's already charged on my credit card TWICE but my Spotify account is not premium yet
@SpotifyCares No pending updates.
@SpotifyCares Phone has 3.82 GB with 721MB free.
@SpotifyCares Holy shit didn't expect a response. 
Running Windows 10 with Spotify Ver 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares Here ya go https://t.co/fMI55xeEf1
@SpotifyCares This worked but now I have to go through and re-download everything. Super frustrating. Not your fault though, thank you for your help.
@SpotifyCares I should say, It doesn't take my money and begin my subscription. It accepts my Paypal.
@SpotifyCares Here you go. spotify:track:1ZL5PqrCxDIDvOE5Ymgr80
@SpotifyCares Any move on this yet?
@SpotifyCares @147836 Order number __credit_card__-2 and her account is salmakusjj
@SpotifyCares thank you!! it's been really bothering me because I keep getting artists I don't want to support and I mainly listen to western artists and only like 2 kpop
@SpotifyCares please bring it back! It was the only good email.
@SpotifyCares Any news of when.. Really want to listen to #Endgame of #reputation given that me and many millions of people pay for "Spotify premium"  🤔🤔🤔
@SpotifyCares Please do all you can to speed up the process, thanks ☺
@SpotifyCares Thanks hopefully it goes through 👍🏽
@SpotifyCares I premium user,I play song,then  in the middle is stopping, already download the playlist.
@SpotifyCares If occur again I give u information.thank you
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!
@SpotifyCares Spotify 8.4.26.770 armV7.

Oxygen 5.0
Android version 8.0.0
@SpotifyCares So this didn't happen before I updated my phone yesterday. Is there any way around this? If my phone is on silent surely this shouldn't happen?
@SpotifyCares I'd like to remain paying $5 a month for only music since I have the student account, rather than $10 with music and HULU
@SpotifyCares Does that mean you just reset my list on Monday like normal or will you improve the algorithm?
@SpotifyCares I've been a Spotify user for a long time now. It should know me by now
@SpotifyCares Idk it was probably just my phone glitching around sorry to drag you guys into this
@SpotifyCares @201794 same problem. Can you answer me?
@SpotifyCares On the change payment details page it says "Loading. Please wait...." but nothing happens.
@SpotifyCares updating an expired card for a family plan. On the latest version of Chrome. OSX
@SpotifyCares I already have it off 🙃
@SpotifyCares I just don’t know what I’m doing I’m new to Spotify
@SpotifyCares I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S6, operating system 7.0, and it's happening over Wi-Fi
@SpotifyCares That worked, thanks!
@SpotifyCares I can use it with out internet you said that we can use it with out internet that is way i write it @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares USA - https://t.co/d0QthWO4hJ https://t.co/5bHTRMMgt6
@SpotifyCares Version 1.0.67.582 desktop, it's doing it both on my iPhone 6 and on Windows 10. Albums worked yesterday https://t.co/idiCYXzX7r
@SpotifyCares Yeah, I'll try that later. I'm sure it'll fix itself by tomorrow morning, but we'll see. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Phone app works, desktop app is still being weird. Closed/restarted, still refuses to play those albums. You can add this one to the list of blocked albums. What's weird is the songs on the album will play if they're on the top 10 most popular songs list. https://t.co/kxuWrX7iBc
@SpotifyCares Hi case closed, I already register used credit card,txs
@SpotifyCares You seriously want me to give feedback on an update from 5 February 2016? :/ I'd rather learn from you how I can truly shuffle/randomise my plays..! I pay for your services and I want some serious advice please.
@SpotifyCares Thanks man i send a iinquiry hope i cn get on spotify man be sick
@SpotifyCares Hey it's 8.4.28.875 and on android :)
@SpotifyCares I've restarted it and.logged out it's still the same:(
@SpotifyCares I don't have another device to test it off unfortunately
@SpotifyCares It's 7.0 :)
@SpotifyCares Didn’t seem to be any option that I could find in the iOS app
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the clarification ;-)
@SpotifyCares Whattt so no justin? https://t.co/JvKc1VJxAL
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the link - have voted and will urge everyone I know to do so. Shall have to see if this limit is a dealbreaker in the meantime
@SpotifyCares Hmmm no I’m not on a trial period . Also it does state that this does not apply to anyone who has previously tried Premium so how do I get around that ?
@SpotifyCares Thank you very much
@SpotifyCares Could you please copy me in on any correspondence. It would be interesting to get a reply to a question many of your customers have been asking for months without adequate response. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares ??
@SpotifyCares So which is it? You're going to let them know or I should let them know? If the latter, I already have. Several times. Along with others. The devs have ignored repeated requests for an update.
@SpotifyCares And pointing me to a four year old thread only highlights this. Why not look at the support behind a more recent 3 month old one?
 https://t.co/Rr6pVozwJR
@SpotifyCares @264368 This canned response is getting old.   Spotify needs to either say “yes we will support multi-room alexa in 2018 or no we will not”.
@SpotifyCares I use the app on my iPhone. By plugging an Apple lightning Connector lead into the USB slot in my car. For some reason it’s not picking the Spotify app when I open it
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 and the latest iOS. I’ve tried logging in and out. Reinstalling the app etc
@SpotifyCares Tried it all. The connected drive doesn’t pick up the app at all, so there’s no error messages
@SpotifyCares DM has sent
@SpotifyCares already have🙁
@SpotifyCares Considering the numerous threads in the Spotify community about issues with queuing songs I'm surprised it's not already a feature.
@SpotifyCares MacOS 10.12.6 and no clue how to tell spotify version. Just started acting up now, and won't play this album at all.
@SpotifyCares Thank you @SpotifyCares !
@SpotifyCares No. Spotify always tries to find similar tracks to ones in my library but often gets it really wrong. There doesn’t seem to be a way to turn that function off. MacBook with latest update of Spotify.
@SpotifyCares I make a lot of playlists (never use the Spotify suggested ones) and at first the tracks show up but often change over time to a similar but wrong track
@SpotifyCares @273122 I though i will only pay 9pesos? But why am i charge of the regular price?
@SpotifyCares Okay Thank you!
@SpotifyCares But the price changes to 129 whenever I try to choose debit card
@SpotifyCares Been hearing that since 2014. It would be nice if you could actually do it
@SpotifyCares Thank you! Looking forward to it!
@SpotifyCares @143967 I have the same situation.. I don't have credit card,but I want to avail the 9php premium thru mobile mode of payment @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares It’s an iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 11.1.2 and it’s he most recent Spotify update
@SpotifyCares I have! But sadly, nothing - should I reinstall the app?
@SpotifyCares Thank you, JJ!
@SpotifyCares It worked! Thank u so much 💕
@SpotifyCares Hi, I can't subscribe for Family plan, after fill in all info it come back to this page as can see in image attached, Thanks
@SpotifyCares Spotify cares.....about new customers only
@SpotifyCares Done. Although I got a feeling you guys be coming to India pretty soon *fingers crossed* :)
@SpotifyCares Yes, I got a verification email saying it was successful. __email__
@SpotifyCares Hi! I've already done this once before and it still happened again, this is the second time. I've followed all of these steps, so hopefully there won't be a third time
@SpotifyCares doesnt work on anything, imac, iphone, web browser etc
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares That's a shame. Discover weekly is always without fail, 99% wonderful and 1% horrid! Insert leaping across the room to skip! Still no worries, I still love Spotify. Just thought I'd throw it in the suggestion box!
@SpotifyCares I guess it was desync
@SpotifyCares That's really not an answer you know!Already part of the waiting list 🙄
@SpotifyCares Today.
@SpotifyCares Thank you will try this!!!
@SpotifyCares SO IF YALL COULD GET BACK TO ME ASAP THAT WOULD BE SUPER
@SpotifyCares I reinstalled app and now won't even let me log in. 'We are currently experiencing problems'
@SpotifyCares Ahah nah I’m fine now, cheers anyway, much love💛👍🏼
@SpotifyCares Soptify app version is 8.4.28.875 arm v7
@SpotifyCares When I plug in my phone to my car via data cable, I get “media connection failed”. I have an iPhone 8+ with the newest ios 11.1.2.
@SpotifyCares I have to plug it in and unplug it a bunch of times and pray that eventually it will connect properly.
@SpotifyCares I don't since Apple products are expensive AF LOL! But I'm currently also chatting with Apple once again, to see what's going on.
@SpotifyCares But I'll keep you updated!
@SpotifyCares Yes, I have!
@SpotifyCares You really need to get your head round your own systems. How can you not know what the issue is? Asking me to send you paperwork is a bit of a joke. What’s actually happening?
@SpotifyCares Lol I’ve been a premium user since 2012 and have literally never seen a promotion open to active subscribers but okay maybe I’ll go ahead and cancel my premium subscription while waiting for these deals
@SpotifyCares Sure: OnePlus 3 running latest version of its OS. Happy to send screen recording if it would help.
@SpotifyCares Uninstalled, rebooted, reinstalled and now it appears stable. I can switch between artists (and have done many many times now) and its not crashed yet. So - sorted! Thanks.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/2LohVx0gDP
@SpotifyCares Thanks. It's now working for me again 🙂
@SpotifyCares I hope it’s gonna be available the next few days, please make this possible. Thank you 🙏🏻
@SpotifyCares I'll let you know if the problem persists. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I had to clear app data and cache to fix it. But just wanted to let you know about the bug.
@SpotifyCares I also need to update my zip code and I don't see that option: https://t.co/NlsHAJbwCU
@SpotifyCares Safari on iOS. Looks to be a server issue https://t.co/lSeoRFeNJq
@SpotifyCares @145996 This has been an issue for multiple users for hours.
@SpotifyCares @776947 Same issues. On mobile device and on the web-browser
@SpotifyCares NVM, it's working again :-)
@SpotifyCares So now I can’t log in to contact customer support and no one has responded to my email
@SpotifyCares @777591 Does it work for premium users though?
@SpotifyCares It did not crash no. Was just quite irritating is all
@SpotifyCares I did indeed yes
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares please can you advise ⬆️
@SpotifyCares Restarting my phone doesn't work, it's version 8.4. 28. 875
@SpotifyCares i already had premium so it’s impossible for me getting three months for $0.99
@SpotifyCares OMG I wasn’t expecting a reply! I’m both excited and embarrassed for myself ahah thank you so much! I completely understand! Fingers crossed!!
@SpotifyCares And to be fair, I really care about children hearing this ad, especially during the Christmas season. You promote your classic Christmas playlist, and it is family oriented. Offending me personally is not relevant.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/bJjcMNUpiw
@SpotifyCares Resolved!
@SpotifyCares @777976 Bring back touch preview.
@SpotifyCares I have. 3 years in a row...
@SpotifyCares @127637 Thanks it seems to be ok now after the device logout / login. Thanks
@SpotifyCares It said “503. No server to handle request”. I’ve gone with Amazon Music now but thank you anyway 😘
@SpotifyCares __email__  Terry OG Bolton via Facebook
@SpotifyCares I can't take a screenshot because the app doesn't allow screenshots. Clearing data and cache fixes the problem, but it is annoying to have to redownload all the offline music after every update.
@SpotifyCares The issue is on the website. I want to purchase premium but as soon as I click on 'Get Premium' I get a 504. It's on both my laptop and my phone https://t.co/wGM71BrwFT
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares (nvm, i was being impatient)
@SpotifyCares I have posted the community. Those seem to be ignored by the dev team
@SpotifyCares @264373 the problem is yours... https://t.co/dD8CMdyk5u
@SpotifyCares Seems like the link has been removed,was offering Spotify premium for 99p for 3 months
@SpotifyCares I'm not sure if that's a good idea to send you the 1st 6 digits PLUS the last 4 digits of my credit card, sounds suspect to me but as I DM you my phone number, please just have someone call me
@SpotifyCares Also, you guys took $4.99 from my account. I want it back!
@SpotifyCares It’s ok working now able to cancel thanks
@SpotifyCares I try to open the system of a down album but it stays loading forever and never opens. https://t.co/mbZbFPmxtM
@SpotifyCares I uninstalled the app and it works! Thx
@SpotifyCares Samsung 8+
@SpotifyCares Signed up for the 3 months for £9.99 deal and I’ve been charged twice and on the website it says my plan will renew next month.
@SpotifyCares Yep - asking for a playlist (even vaguely!) or a specific song works absolutely fine. I've tried a range of artists all on Spotify but Alexa isn't playing nice. As I said, super weird because it was fine last week!
@SpotifyCares Thanks LM, I tried that before tweeting. I’ve opened a ticket with the Amazon Alexa support team so I’ll see what they come back with. I don’t want to be a burden on two teams! :)
@SpotifyCares Device iPhone and iPad. Doesn’t work on either devices. Support please! I miss my music 😭
@SpotifyCares Im using an iPhone 8 iOS 11
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares help pls, I’ve tried incognito, different browsers and nothing seems to work
@SpotifyCares Not able to login due to http 504  gateway timeout, then problems with nginx web server. Though seems like it's resolved.
@SpotifyCares still can't get to https://t.co/Xe6cO5eoHR https://t.co/JgSCrfdabV
@SpotifyCares Well I am a college student and have tried updating my account since the beginning of the semester and it says it updates but still charges
@SpotifyCares Me full price
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares Same
@SpotifyCares Will do so now I wait
@SpotifyCares Sorted, thanks!
Took over an hour and several different devices, but done.
Kept receiving a server error.
Thanks for getting back to me.
(Just got to wait &amp; go through 8 days of kids arguing for Premium for Family now) 😂👍
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares It's ok now indeed 😃
@SpotifyCares Sorted it guys, thanks
@SpotifyCares thanks i appreciate it
@SpotifyCares It's just saying the page is not there 😭
@SpotifyCares Tried it again .. it says I'm not eligible 😭😭
@SpotifyCares Ok so I've just logged onto my free Spotify.. it's now offering 9.99 for 3 months which is amazing but no link to get it. You guys make it's so difficult to get premium
@SpotifyCares Just verified! Thanks
@SpotifyCares Thanks so much! I'll give it a try tonight.
@SpotifyCares So I have to go through 90+ songs going 🚫 before the algorithms correct themselves? Can a more direct method be used?
@SpotifyCares The pattern I've recognised is that there are approx 9 mixes that only rotate out of Daily Mix 6, leaving 5 mixes stale. Can it be reset?
@SpotifyCares It doesn't. Because if it's supposed to be based on what I listen to, why haven't the 5 highlighted not changed since the feature rolled out? Daily Mix 6 is the only one that changes (inconveniently too, as it will refresh in the middle of my play session) https://t.co/vik1r3UF01
@SpotifyCares There was a mix in the Daily Mix 6 slot a couple of weeks ago that I was listening to non-stop and it just vanished on Monday morning.
@SpotifyCares I have done that. The problem is that this was brought up in 2013 and then again in 2017. It saddens me that companies Just point you to what I feel is a useless up vote as a simple means of saying we hear you, but we aren't going to taken any action
@SpotifyCares Mine's actually working fine now! They are very speedy tech folks! Thank you! :D
@SpotifyCares Gutted. Wanna share with the in-laws. Anything in the works for catering for this arrangement?
@SpotifyCares Okay thanks. I threw together a quick link in Photoshop instead... https://t.co/Im2ICn2kWw
@SpotifyCares I think I got the monthly payments to work.  Do I need to reinvite my kids or should their accounts switch back to premium automatically?
@SpotifyCares hey so my account is linked to an old email that i dont remember the password to... so i cant get inthere to change my password
@SpotifyCares Yes no luck
@SpotifyCares How do i clear the space then? Because it keeps going up and up.
@SpotifyCares Maybe around 300 now. Cause i cleared about 150 off this morning. But it didn't go down in size
@SpotifyCares Ill give it a shot when i get home tonight. Thanks for the help 👍👍
@SpotifyCares No, looking better. Ill test tomorrow.
@SpotifyCares It works fine on the Mac, and it’s happening on both, files are saved! And it’s an iPhone X
@SpotifyCares don't worry, already been in contact and changed my passwords. just letting ya'll know since ya'll were oblivious.
@SpotifyCares I'm unable to log out as all I can see is the logo and then the error message. The only thing that help is to reinstall the app each time it happens which is basically every day. Super-annoying for premium user. https://t.co/4pWIFWAieR
@SpotifyCares Tha k you and sorry for coming off as harsh!
@SpotifyCares Hi I spoke to someone on the online chat and it’s been resolved thank you though
@SpotifyCares iphone 6 version 8.4.28
@SpotifyCares thanks man
@SpotifyCares Brilliant-thank you!
@SpotifyCares It’s all good guys, it’s working now! Thank you for responding anyways👍🏻
@SpotifyCares Already chatted in, but thanks
@SpotifyCares I tried that and it didn’t work but then I tried “Troubleshoot compatibility” and it worked 🙂, I’ve been trying to load this for a long time , felt I was wasting my money , but all seems okay now , thankyou.
@SpotifyCares Is there anyway of finding out when? Thanks. Just I used to listen to it and now it's disappeared everywhere
@SpotifyCares Spotify Premium desktop app, Windows 10, 1.0.67.582.g19436fa3
@SpotifyCares Cheers!
@SpotifyCares how can i disconnect my account from facebook to just an email????
@SpotifyCares can you reply to my DM though....
@SpotifyCares thanks for reply! I restarted my phone and had to delete/redownload the app. Any easy way to redownload all my saved music?
@SpotifyCares thank you! i really appreciate yout response
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I would like to delete all downloaded and not downloaded songs in my library. I need a palette cleanser 😁
@SpotifyCares Oh, I'm sorry po! Yes, It's fine with me. 😊 So, let's say.. after the Promo. Will it deduct automatically as the normal Premium of Spotify? Since Spotify has our credit/debit card no.? Sorry, I'm really confused. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares It looks like user error. Since the titles are in English and Spanish for both languages I may have downloaded the wrong version.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/ohqkkkiYkr
@SpotifyCares It's an Onkyo TX-NR626, on the latest updates.
@SpotifyCares Yep, they are! It's very repeatable too.if the phone is left on spotify and screen locks, unlocking disconnects it and stops payback. If spotify is minimised and brought back into the foreground it immediately stops playback and disconnects. If background for &gt;5 min sptfy closes
@SpotifyCares @783000 I applied for this promo using my globe account. How come i was still charged P129 ? @115888  @642
@SpotifyCares I would have hoped that after 3 years it would be done by now guess I’ll be going to Apple Music
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares 😒
@SpotifyCares Yeah I read it. Because people "didn't use it" silly. If the devs actually read the comments, people aren't happy about it.
@SpotifyCares No problem
@SpotifyCares The payment issue is resolved, my premium is back! Thanks
@SpotifyCares please help the support page is so unhelpful and i just wanna use yr service i love my goofy music account
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares My student subscription did not renew which caused my Hulu account to deactivate and my premium to jump back to $9.99. I’ve taken a break for fall term, but I am returning for spring. How can I get my student account back.
@SpotifyCares Hi, i’ve just send you a DM. Please follow up. Thankyou
@SpotifyCares fix this @115940 and @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Oh your link shows the same deal I can’t get. #imnotcrying
@SpotifyCares Yeah. Playlists seem unaffected, just albums vanish from offline. On version 8.4.28.875 armV7
@SpotifyCares @115888
@SpotifyCares Thankyou!
@SpotifyCares everything ok thank you
@SpotifyCares Thank youuu 😘
@SpotifyCares Samsung galaxy s6, with andriod operating system. Its happening on wifi, data, and offline.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! I thoroughly enjoy what you offer! That particular one seemed out of place.
@SpotifyCares Hi unfortunately I can only think of two emails but they do not have Spotify premium. Would it help if I sent you any paypal information?
@SpotifyCares But
But why
It makes no sense
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I've gone ahead and submitted the contact form
@SpotifyCares I have nothing in my DM from y’all.
@SpotifyCares ok, i ask about this promo valid till when? thanks
@SpotifyCares I tried using my PC but same thing happened
@SpotifyCares iOS iphone7 and also on windows desktop
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/UHLT8TkLMM
@SpotifyCares Kelly Jones has not released any collaborations soloon Spotify. Also the Kelly Jones you are referring to is a girl if you listen to those songs @56272 @113730 @113731 please inform them these songs are not Kelly from stereophonics https://t.co/2R2T2tWsPj
@SpotifyCares Already tried this route. https://t.co/zAbaFzWBM9
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/6sIFZBoWY1
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/jZuCyyRNIY
@SpotifyCares Thank you 🤗hope in the future you can have them 😇
@SpotifyCares Y’all have been saying that for years how hard is it to just aimply release it, damn
@SpotifyCares Sigh, just tell them that The Bahamas exists too 😩
@SpotifyCares I use spotify every day and this is the message i’ve been getting every time i’ve clicked the link in the past two months https://t.co/SIxatLn8l7
@SpotifyCares Sent  over 8 hrs ago?
@SpotifyCares Thank you, well problem still not resolved for now..
@SpotifyCares Sorry! Didn't see this notification. Email should be __email__. connected to my Facebook account of the same name as this one
@SpotifyCares You keep sending me to your “help” links and community board. Can you actually advise and fix? I can get to the help links myself.
@SpotifyCares You haven’t responded
@SpotifyCares No, 5GB of my Internet Bundle 😡
@SpotifyCares Thanks! iOS is 11.0.3 on iPhone 6s Spotify app 8.4.28.1104

When using the extreme setting in Spotify on my MacBook it’s indicating a high rate. But with the phone app it’s indicating about 48kps no matter what quality setting is selected 

Thanks again for your help 😃
@SpotifyCares Like hellooooooooo !!!!!
@SpotifyCares oh hi thanks :)
@SpotifyCares Yo I appreciate it. This is a recommendation of a push notification feature for playlist updates.
@SpotifyCares spotify: 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf
macbook pro: MacOS Sierra, version 10.12.1
@SpotifyCares I've gone through the list and reinstalled spotify and its still not downloading all the songs. Even on the fresh reinstall when I click download it says 'downloading 1 of 137' even though there's 260 songs in the playlist.
@SpotifyCares Will NUS be available at any point? It used to be
@SpotifyCares I have the roku streaming stick and wanted to listen to Spotify but the UI is ugly as sin, there’s no playlist options. It looks like you guys haven’t updated or supported it for a decade
@SpotifyCares So basically it’s going to stay ugly so use something else?
@SpotifyCares It doesn’t because you’re basically telling me to buy another device that does what the roku does just to listen to Spotify. Are there any plans on making Spotify work well and not look like trash on Rokus?
@SpotifyCares Why bother even having it if it is not even a shell of itself? I’d rather not even have the option then to have some watered down awful UI version. Makes you guys look bad
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/sP3p5wppUY
@SpotifyCares win 7 ultimate 64 bits. spotify 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf. and not, logging or rebooting doesn't work, because every time it updates, it reinstates the boot with windows option. i've even killed the windows startup process, but it's there every time it updates again and again
@SpotifyCares please pass it on. and thank you!
my pc is a bit old and it kills my windows booting performance.
@SpotifyCares Logged out and back in again and I think we have lift off-thank you!
@SpotifyCares Yes. From indonesia.
@SpotifyCares Still....
@SpotifyCares There is no instruction there to add a Spotify Account which was opened/created in Facebook.
@SpotifyCares Thanks guys, I’ll just have to be patient then xx
@SpotifyCares Then i have a question about https://t.co/RYxaLhbRTx numbers. Day before the number i showed in picture was ~1.74m, now, as in picture, it is ~3.64m. So, approx 1.8/1.9m in the last day. But in chart shows that it had only ~700k streams in last day. Which number is wrong then?
@SpotifyCares + The number in question is global streams for 26th of nov
@SpotifyCares Same thing today. On app shows total streams ~4.875m (as yesterday was 3.64m), the difference is ~1.23m today, but on global streams only ~765k shows up..
Where is the rest?
@SpotifyCares Here is the screen shot https://t.co/gVmQp9wMV2
@SpotifyCares I already tried this trial deal, and ever since it ran out Im having 4-5 ads them a song then another chain of ads. Not the way it should work.
And on top of it, when I listen to ads that should give 30 min ad free, I still get ads after. Horrible experience so far.
@SpotifyCares Nope, running it normal, having same with app open or closed. I already sent tickets to support before, but nothing changed. Im updating my app (ios) each time new one appears in hope it will fix it. Been like this for couple of months now.
@SpotifyCares thanks a lot!
@SpotifyCares (wrong poll), but thanks for the try.  I can't seem to add my vote to the ∞ already received - I'd also like to be able to manage it from the family account instead of the app.. https://t.co/W7whtWTqiM
@SpotifyCares Ahh good to know thanks 😁
@SpotifyCares Hit play &amp; it stops. Anything from 1 to 3 secs. Working fine now. Does happen 2 to 4 times a week. Sorts itself in mins to an hour, as you keep checking. Using an HP Spectre x2 laptop (detachable) Windows 10. I've looked through Settings for 'search for updates' but to avail.
@SpotifyCares Next tine it happens I'll go the router route 😎
Last year in the 2nd week of December, I received an email listing my Spotify listening statistics. (59,900 minutes) it was fascinating. Will that happen again this year? 
Thanks guys
@SpotifyCares thank you for caring xx
@SpotifyCares I'm using the PC version and it's been happening a lot, it will non stop repeat the add even when it's over with. And I'm not sure what version I'm using.
@SpotifyCares I've got it working now I restarted my pc and reinstalled it, works perfectly fine now! Thanks for trying to help me!!!!
@SpotifyCares Okay, I definitely will!!
@SpotifyCares Sent you guys a DM.
@SpotifyCares Cheers boys
@SpotifyCares the audio for "It Takes To Long To Learn To Live Alone" plays when I click on "I Keep It Hid" and vice versa https://t.co/xbHWyELYVq
@SpotifyCares (cont) instead it’s matching the next song.
@SpotifyCares I am using an iPhone 6s and am on iOS 11.1.1 and Spotify 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares It didn’t help :/
@SpotifyCares That’s strange because ALL my songs are not displaying the adaptive feature :/ Hoping for the best!
@SpotifyCares Still nothing :/
@SpotifyCares Okay :( when it'll launch in india?
@SpotifyCares Sure... Thanks
@SpotifyCares Oh come on. Help us all out and just put it on 💃🏼
@SpotifyCares It's okay I figured it out! Thanks anyway though, I love Spotify! Best streaming service!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 7 Plus and iOS 11.1.2 but I've had issues dating back to iOS 10
@SpotifyCares DM sent
@SpotifyCares iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.3 Spotify version 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.3 Spotify version 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares Right so there's been no movement made on fixing/replacing the app. Cool. Just say that. Say, "we haven't prioritized it right now and don't have an eta. Sorry."
@SpotifyCares Im trying to set up my profile as an artist and upload my music on there 🙏🏻🙄
@SpotifyCares Restarting worked! Thanks :)
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the quick response. So I could be logged into my phone and another device at the same time?
@SpotifyCares @128065 Oh man, @115888 has a minimum window height *and* width. That's a disgrace.
@SpotifyCares @128065 I use a tiling WM on macOS and these two mess it up by trying to pretend they have more authority about where windows are placed on my system than I do.
@SpotifyCares I NEED AN IMMEDIATE EXPLANATION PLEASE
@SpotifyCares Should be the US
@SpotifyCares thanks to answer... I unistall and install the app again and it is working now
@SpotifyCares The account is Facebook connected.
@SpotifyCares I'm giving it all she's got, cap'n!
@SpotifyCares Have you met, @413612? Y'all should hang out. 😂
@SpotifyCares Check your DM @SpotifyCares
@SpotifyCares Thnx. Do your algorithms know when I’m skipping tracks/ not listening to the whole track?
@SpotifyCares Thnx. Mostly listen on iPhone. You used to be able to do that on the iOS app right? No more? :(
@SpotifyCares Thankyou - that worked.  Very very weird that they were spontaneously deleted and two playlists with... strange.... titles were created.  Am absolutely certain nobody else has my login.
@SpotifyCares I'm on my cellphone..but it works fine on my laptop.
@SpotifyCares Yes I've restarted my phone twice...and what do you mean operating device system and Spotify versions?
@SpotifyCares I have an LG K10 and  and the version is 8.4.28.875 armV7 I took a screenshot. https://t.co/xZhajAZ8y5
@SpotifyCares Both WiFi and 4G. And I think it's been going on for a week and a half.
@SpotifyCares y’all just fucking did it again https://t.co/xtgUl3r0QM
@SpotifyCares they’re still there but all my downloads were deleted and the albums saved have half the songs missing now
@SpotifyCares I am having a US Spotify account, I am in India traveling fora while. and because of this situation I am not able to play music on my Spotify !!
@SpotifyCares @108393 here needs help :)
@SpotifyCares @791701 * :)
@SpotifyCares Thank you 😊
@SpotifyCares Truly appreciate the boiler plate response on how you plan to reintroduce basic features you once had 🙄
@SpotifyCares Thank you. I’ll keep the hot needles away for now.
@SpotifyCares Ah. False alarm. Boo. It's in the radio though... doesn't feel like the far stretch to implement into DW, but I can barely spell 'code'.
@SpotifyCares However, if I’m playing music and open snapchat, it stops too and won’t reply. I have to open Spotify, and cold reboot the app by holding the power button until the power off sign and then the home button.
@SpotifyCares Happens during both. Yes the restart helps, but then it just randomly happens again
@SpotifyCares I can't sign out everywhere. https://t.co/eiAJZdbrLJ
@SpotifyCares You’re too late I’m afraid. Already got it working now.
@SpotifyCares Hello! I know. iPhone 7, IOS, version 8.4.28.1104 - have emailed you.
@SpotifyCares I downloaded the app 4 times, tried email login to which you guys basically responded "NEIN. Human use Facebook, human no email login !" And then you're encountering problems, a whole lot of them, every time.
@SpotifyCares So it’s a Spotify thing, not a sonos thing?
@SpotifyCares Sorry - why would I want to revoke access? I want to use Spotify on my sonos..:
@SpotifyCares I've been waiting for the playlist to be "more in tune" since weeks but nothing is changing...
@SpotifyCares Do you see how red my forehead is from facepalming? DO YOU??!? =/
@SpotifyCares Stand down, stand down! I was making a joke to your joke. =)
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you is the bottom bars thats gone  appear again and how to get to the music that i saved
@SpotifyCares Managed to find it, but thanks for getting back to me.
@SpotifyCares Okay, now I just logged back on.
@SpotifyCares @793152 Yes please! We need Spotify on our TV!
@SpotifyCares You guys better hurry
@SpotifyCares By the way you are DV? I’m DV ✌🏼
@SpotifyCares Thanks I’ll have a play with it. Must admit though, I’ve just adjusted music quality and can’t tell difference between normal and extreme
@SpotifyCares Not tried will do. Would it be a very noticeable difference? How would this affect the sound through @118117 ?? Also the majority of my streaming is on WiFi so data wouldn’t be an issue
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares doesnt care
@SpotifyCares Thank you☺
@SpotifyCares it’s an iPhone 8 ios 11.1.1 and Spotify version 8.4.28
@SpotifyCares Oh man :'( Lost all my good inboxed music
@SpotifyCares No worries, you're awesome really
@SpotifyCares While we're talking, do you know how to view last weeks discovery playlist? I forgot to save a song I can't remember the name of 😕
@SpotifyCares Yes, thank you! It works now, I uploaded couple of times, I think the problem was with Windows.. maybe... Thank you for your reply 😃
@SpotifyCares No no, you have the content available, you just aren't highlighting it enough within your "Happy Holidays" mood/genre 😉 IMHO @154226 's #WrappedInRed is the best holiday album! And her new Xmas single "Christmas Eve" should be promoted in Happy Holidays - New Releases.
@SpotifyCares Goodnight idk what MA are you but goodnight Friend MA
@SpotifyCares That sorted it thanks
@SpotifyCares I had to reinstall Spotify iOS once to fix it but still have the occasional problem connecting. It’s just not as seamless as it used to be.
@SpotifyCares The latest iOS update. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Haha thx for your reply. Don't worry, it's fine, I was just amazed by how well the algorithm works because it even played music I actually used to listen to but haven't in ages... 😀
@SpotifyCares 1650 votes, so far, but the solution is not in their pipeline... Go figure.
@SpotifyCares Hey hey! It unfortunately does not. It could be a bug within Twitter, Spotify or even iOS itself. It’s not a big deal, just wanted to let y’all know.
@SpotifyCares It comes up with this option however we are in England therefore have a postcode not zip code ? https://t.co/iwqW12BfQl
@SpotifyCares When I click on accept invite and sign in it comes up with the following "undefined- oops something went wrong" message https://t.co/UyoGWJL6nF
@SpotifyCares My playlist was depressing as heck, u made me upset
@SpotifyCares @793822 Add some Russian music for her. Or Ukrainian. Vladimir likes that.
@SpotifyCares Yea it's the newest update on my Samsung S7 Edge. Even with songs I have saved offline it'll cut out while it's playing 🤦🏾
@SpotifyCares Ah it's OK I got it sorted, thank you
@SpotifyCares I’m on iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 11.1.2 - latest version of the Spotify app, AFAIK
@SpotifyCares Followed your directions (log out, restart device, login). This did not fix my issue.
@SpotifyCares Uninstalled and reinstalled Spotify app. This has not fixed my issue.
@SpotifyCares Moto G4 plus, Android 7 and Spotify version 8.4.28.875 arm v7. I just try anything what I could find from support sites and nothing worked. Thanks in advance
@SpotifyCares Still waiting!
@SpotifyCares Thanks guys really can't wait to hear this mixtape
@SpotifyCares It's not crossfade, I was referring to the slight fading when a track is paused. I saw a thread about the same thing on your community, but it didn't seem to generate enough interest. I'll try posting about it again. 🤔😊
@SpotifyCares Thanks a bunch! I figured out the connect part through your community, it's a great resource. Thanks again for being so caring! 😊
@SpotifyCares 2nd one, artis: Park - the "reefer madness" single(s) at the bottom as well as all of the uh, Russian (?) singles at the bottom do not belong https://t.co/trGINPjjqr thank you!
@SpotifyCares None of the above helped. I’m on an iPhone 8 Plus, iOS 11.1.2 and the latest Spotify version 8.4.28.1104. A’s I said I do use zoomed view in display options and a slightly larger reading font but this should only affect apps that support it.
@SpotifyCares No that didn’t fix it. It is definitely the text size doing it as setting it to normal fixes the issue. Unfortunately I need the larger font and this wasn’t a problem until the latest version.
@SpotifyCares No the text is overlapping. You can’t even select items sometimes because the app thinks you are touching another link on the screen nearby.
@SpotifyCares No, only Spotify app.
@SpotifyCares Exactly what I said. There are no "play now" or "play next" buttons, so the only way to listen to a song is to interrupt the song I'm listening to or add it to the end of the queue.
@SpotifyCares As you can see, there's no option to play the album immediately. If I add to queue, it gets pushed to the end. https://t.co/RgjMfd58X5
@SpotifyCares I don't understand why shuffle is a prominent option, especially on full albums. I don't want to shuffle an album, I want to listen to it in order. https://t.co/hL6JbMwMYO
@SpotifyCares As you can see, there's no option to play the album immediately. If I add to queue, it gets pushed to the end. https://t.co/RgjMfd58X5
@SpotifyCares Just sent you a DM 😘
@SpotifyCares Ok. Why dont you give someting to the customers thats been loyal for 5years+. To keep existing customers is much cheaper than getting new ones. Just saying.
@SpotifyCares My app hasn't crashed at all, but it seems as though it plays 2 songs and another ad plays. It frequently does this.
@SpotifyCares Yes I did.
@SpotifyCares What if I just cry instead?????
@SpotifyCares ad on instagram stories, for spotify, showing a manson photo and a title suggesting "cult" playlists. was too surprised on how low did you go to take a screenshot.
@SpotifyCares I wasn't asking about (or suggesting) censoring - I'm saying the songs are mislabeled.
@SpotifyCares spotify:track:4hjbxjZpJ8H6qRCzDOGI0M
(At the 1:23, and 1:34 mark)
@SpotifyCares ... I'm not optimistic there.

I hoped there was an existing way to repeatedly help with a product I like. Sounds like there isn't.
@SpotifyCares It's a 6.0 and it doesnt😔😔
@SpotifyCares That's the bit I'm talking about. None of them apply :/
@SpotifyCares Thanks for fixing it! 🙌🏼
@SpotifyCares Thank you! ✌
@SpotifyCares Bollocks, it didn't work. Any other tips/tricks? TIA
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/X7yxgIgTE5
@SpotifyCares I already did that. News websites in Romania said spotify will be available in Romania today 28th november, thats why i am asking.
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares HELLOOOOO HEELLPP
@SpotifyCares There are some rumours here in Romania regarding your service launch on 28 november. Even the press related about this!
@SpotifyCares Yes I have tried both. Also reinstalled over WiFi and 4g
@SpotifyCares I only have this device. Are you going to try and fix the problem or carry on asking me stupid questions?
@SpotifyCares App doesn't load, only this black screen, and then press anything (library for example) and this message pops up https://t.co/CYVq3xXLTj
@SpotifyCares Already tried with no success
@SpotifyCares You wouldn't know how much longer would ya?
@SpotifyCares This is great news. I just voted! Thank you.
@SpotifyCares What happens normally? Can you usually not skip a track and have to listen to the song? Or does it start an advert instead? 🙂 thanks for your reply.
@SpotifyCares Certainly does, thanks for your help :)
@SpotifyCares On iOS it’s 8.4.28.1104 and I just reinstalled the Spotify app on my pc. Don’t know the version
@SpotifyCares I have done so. Still nothing. This is frustrating
@SpotifyCares This is what I get everytime https://t.co/wFFbalGfuo
@SpotifyCares I played it from my computer and when it pops up on my phone to play it on my phone that’s the message I get
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much. Well hoping I’ll get there someday !
@SpotifyCares @7997 Amazing, thank you! @7997, here is just a small sampling of what I've done as a producer over the last decade. https://t.co/TG4U77qsOX
@SpotifyCares I used to have a bunch of saved albums I could listen to on the train/plane/subway. Then today I discover that nothing is saved any more.
@SpotifyCares I usually play the albums on shuffle so not sure, but I've only recently started having this problem. Normally even after all the songs have shuffled through, the album just replays.
@SpotifyCares Yup that's what I did right after, looks like it solved the issue! Thx for the follow up 👌
@SpotifyCares I ASKED "WHEN"
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares I was listening to a particular mix already established and then all of a sudden it disappeared. Super frustrating.
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much!!!!
@SpotifyCares United States!
@SpotifyCares But what about playlists within a folder. It’s different. Maybe not though
@SpotifyCares iPhone/MacBook latest versions. So if I have the same song in playlist 1, and playlist 7 in a folder it should prompt me?
@SpotifyCares Thank you, appreciate it!
@SpotifyCares I signed up using the app through my Facebook. I-click Create Account but it errors
@SpotifyCares O, I forgot, you cannot do a screenshot with Spotify app
@SpotifyCares The only other device I use Spotify on with a DAC is my Macbook which plays the high resolution sample rate without any issues...
@SpotifyCares That’s super disappointing. That thread was started over 3 years ago and no comment? Come on.
@SpotifyCares when will it be available ??
@SpotifyCares Ah, gotcha. I’ll just keep plugging away then in the hope that the right person hears it. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Thank you! Yup, just one more thing actually, how do I get on a playlist?
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Oh I mean as an artist, how does ones music get into the ears of a curator and then onto a playlist? 🖤
@SpotifyCares I’m not sure if it was a specific update. Those steps did not fix it. Sorry I don’t have more specific info
@SpotifyCares So much for ‘digital remaster’ eh? :/
@SpotifyCares another web browser works, that is something I suppose
@SpotifyCares all good now, thanks :)
@SpotifyCares WiFi with LTE assistance
@SpotifyCares https://t.co/4NKPp8YCGX
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/AWo6BXnxBi
@SpotifyCares So.. the album Regional at Best from Twenty One Pilots are not available. How to get this album in spotify? https://t.co/ifG2RvIGBy
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks
@SpotifyCares LG g4 android
@SpotifyCares Android version 6.0
@SpotifyCares Wi-Fi. Restarting my phone made no difference.
@SpotifyCares Hey, thanks for getting back. I have a Samsung 7, Kernel version OS, Spotify 8.4.28.875
@SpotifyCares See, I've done this already. I still have the same problems. I'll do it again and see if it's any different
@SpotifyCares Hey! So I have an update! So after a second uninstall and reinstall theres some progress. As far as the widget goes, it's back working like normal. However, the shuffle is still very weird. Example of a song starts with A it'll only go through A-C and back around.
@SpotifyCares Or, how about you support modern browsers. Like browsers that ship with computers. I’m not installing Chrome. Get with the times.
@SpotifyCares Also, on that acc I've been getting random Spanish music randomly put on, so somebody must have hacked it
@SpotifyCares No, I never heard of that email
@SpotifyCares WHEN WILL IT BE???
@SpotifyCares That’s stupid
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response! I am not currently getting any error messages. I am using version 8.4.28.875 armV7, and my device is a Samsung Galaxy S6 which uses Android 😁
@SpotifyCares The Android version is 7.0, &amp; this is happening off Wi-Fi, however, I haven't tried my 4G with the app since the issue started occurring.

I should add that it seems to be pausing/skipping songs when I have my phone locked, more so than when I have my device unlocked.
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares More like @1629 amiright? 👎
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the response. I guess I’m just confused because @115821 said, in late August, that it’d be coming soon. The fact that you don’t have information on it makes soon seem...untruthful.
@SpotifyCares Thanks, RH! So if for example I cancel my subscription’s auto renewal and try to redeem this, am I going to be able by then?
@SpotifyCares __email__
@SpotifyCares Thank you for a response. We solved it out already. Thanks to your colleague!
@SpotifyCares But they didn't get into my account. They just clicked th forgot password button. Still suspicious and they should be banned from your service.
@SpotifyCares So there's nothing Spotify will do on their end to ensure malicious users are kept off their network.

Good to know!
@SpotifyCares Galaxy note 5-android, hp spectre x360-windows, and spotify versions are up to date on both
@SpotifyCares iPad mini2, iPhone SE, both iOS 11.1.2 - but this issue is dated back before iOS 11 (hoped the updates will do something about it...) and it occures on both saved and streamed songs (either on WiFi or mobile). Desktop is fine.
@SpotifyCares It stops between tracks (sometimes even Shuffle Play won’t start) - but only before certain ones (as I said, most of them are recently added to playlists). Autoplay is enabled on all devices.
@SpotifyCares @115888 Tried it on my work computer (mac with same settings) with fresh install/cache folder deleted and the test account also does not work with keyboard hot keys. Spacebar will pause and start when spotify window is focused but nothing else works.
@SpotifyCares Sounds good.
@SpotifyCares There's a lot of students here in the EU who don't own credit cards. Me included. Not sure why this is sooo hard :(
@SpotifyCares All sorted now, thanks though 👍
@SpotifyCares I wasn't able to get that working to get it added to my artist page, but when I searched today it was there, so resolved. But is there generally a delay between playlist creation and its availability in search?
@SpotifyCares It's a 2015 Mazda 6 Sport and an iPhone 7 Plus running latest iOS 11 build... thanks!
@SpotifyCares Version is 8.4.28.1104. Happens over device restarts. In-fact over different phones.
@SpotifyCares It was my previous iPhone. I don't have an Android phone to check it on... sorry!
@SpotifyCares Ayy cutie it's okie.. You guys need to reward us subscribers too ay cause we've been paying RM15/month lol
@SpotifyCares It’s mostly running in the background for hours on end even though I have Background App Refresh turned off on my iPhone 6s. I guess it might be a software issue with the app itself? https://t.co/6lrHf4hYR9
@SpotifyCares Thanks
@SpotifyCares It'd be cool to at least be able to find local files on mobile
@SpotifyCares Desktop doesn't connect to Wi-Fi
@SpotifyCares My friend encountered this issue as well. Ive already tried removing all apps and devices listed on the account page. Strangley the random devices dont appear in the device list 4 the account but in the player.
@SpotifyCares I see that in Android mobile and Windows PC.
When see Strauss autor can see Tchaikovsky song as most played, and song of a band named Strauss.
@SpotifyCares For example: https://t.co/jsR3LdOR32
Or
https://t.co/qifSy91zne
@SpotifyCares @799897 Hi - same problem. Gone from 20+ playlists to just 3, where did they all go?
@SpotifyCares Intro Offer?
@SpotifyCares Why? You are asking me to delete because of your slow answer?
@SpotifyCares Thank you! I will try these 😊
@SpotifyCares 😡
@SpotifyCares Should you not give you members a better deal my son loves listening to his music and pays his £9-99 you should try and be fair with everyone
@SpotifyCares @218968 Totally forgot the link! 🤦‍♀️

https://t.co/rAtjclebLf
@SpotifyCares What do you mean of mobile provider? https://t.co/FvdcOx5rwK
@SpotifyCares Problem seems to be remediated
@SpotifyCares 🙏🏼
@SpotifyCares Also puzzled by timing - post was 23rd Feb. Yet I've sent/received songs more recently (in last few months), so why the delay? And with no notification for customers, who wouldn't think to look this up on the Community? V poor service :( Please, please reverse the decision 2/2
@SpotifyCares Thank you. I realise this isn’t your decision as customer support folks!
@SpotifyCares REPLY ASAP. TY
@SpotifyCares Hi There @SpotifyCares I just wanna highlight that there is a mistake made on the banner on Spotify Indonesia’s website. On the banner it says Rp 4.990 / 3 months, where as it should be Rp 49.990 / 3 months. Hope this clarifies :)
@SpotifyCares Ohhh ok. Thank you Spotify for replying! This has been helpful thank you!
@SpotifyCares No problem! It looks like there are two pages for the artist. Here's one:
https://t.co/45cu7GBjkI
@SpotifyCares And here's the other: https://t.co/WgeerXX67Z
@SpotifyCares Thanks!
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8, iOS 11.1.2, version Spotify 8.4.28.1104
@SpotifyCares Windows 10, 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf
@SpotifyCares No. Neither did updating to the latest verson or restarting my computer. It has been like this for 8 days. Very strange.. this is the playlist: https://t.co/oN5yYFyKni https://t.co/oIsa027yc6
@SpotifyCares I didn't say it was your fault really, just want more of it available
@SpotifyCares Issue was fix thanks
@SpotifyCares spotify also says im not eligible for student? how can i confirm im a student? i have a valid education email
@SpotifyCares Why???
@SpotifyCares Excellent work. Thank you, Spots.
@SpotifyCares Not that I noticed— just music then suddenly two back-to-back ads, which I’ve been getting on PC, too. I wouldn’t mind, if it wasn’t for the 30-minutes thing on mobile. But a general explanation as to why im getting double ads in general works too.
@SpotifyCares This is what pops up when I go to activate it on Spotify https://t.co/Pqpi6TllXx
@SpotifyCares okay. i clicked the auto-play off. as for the playlists with more than 15 songs, that shouldn't make a difference. i have short playlists, do i need to delete those now?
@SpotifyCares Looks like we have a winner...hopefully thus will work on my Alexa at home.  She says, "No account associated"?
@SpotifyCares Here's the URI. spotify:artist:3CmmTV2PnTvIMemDyPC5qb

The On the Pull and LOOKER (2006) singles and Born Too Late and Born in the Desert albums belong to one group.

Not sure about the rest. Seem to be one or two different groups there.
@SpotifyCares umm https://t.co/h4GNwYiHuX
@SpotifyCares Version 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf now, but the freeze happened shortly after I started up and got the 'updating' message. Windows error logs don't seem to have anything.
@SpotifyCares There's no problem now. Once I've crashed out of windows and rebooted it works OK. But I have had this happen 3 or 4 times always when starting up the desktop app.
@SpotifyCares PS: That sorting is neither the one I have when I use it, which is by date of inclusion, nor, alphabetical, nor by song, etc... I think it's completely random.
@SpotifyCares Only been waiting 5 years!!!
@SpotifyCares haha thank you !! 😏
@SpotifyCares Ok cool, how many artists do I have to add before the suggested tracks go away? Guessing there’s no manual switch to turn it off then?
@SpotifyCares @803974 I have the same pro
@SpotifyCares As I wrote before, all is working now, after erasing all data for the app.
@SpotifyCares Anyone out there?
@SpotifyCares Offended by the insinuation
@SpotifyCares thank u~
@SpotifyCares I have a US premium account.
@SpotifyCares thanks for the info!
@SpotifyCares Iphone7, Apple IOS version 11.1.2, Fido and the spotify version is attached as a picture to this tweet https://t.co/7MZC8ICuf5
@SpotifyCares Also no update happened during !
@SpotifyCares Its also stopping when i open @917
@SpotifyCares I've just slid into them. Thanks JX
@SpotifyCares Well after the update most of the songs sound robotic
@SpotifyCares It sounds like a pitched up version of T-Pain on every song
@SpotifyCares OK I did that and it seems OK for now
@SpotifyCares There is already a LOT of people who explained the problem there. Now we're waiting for a solution but it's like you really don't care about people listening to music this way.
@SpotifyCares Thanx.
@SpotifyCares Keep getting that error message on both my iPhone 7 and my iPad. I believe I've the most recent app. Was working fine up to about half an hour ago. My internet connection is fine so it's not that.
@SpotifyCares Tried both, no joy.
@SpotifyCares Tried that already with a 4G connection, still no joy.
@SpotifyCares Any luck finding out what the issue is your side? I've done everything I can and it appears others are having similar issues!
@SpotifyCares Yes, I know it too much. The question is why? And why don't you change it as more and more people are hitting this boring limit.
@SpotifyCares It's a Samsung. Thanks. I just get this screen https://t.co/uKnDCxAhTy
@SpotifyCares Nothing happened when I tapped the icons, I have however now restarted my phone, and all is working! Thanks for your help! ☺
@SpotifyCares No worries , all sorted now
@SpotifyCares I have an iPhone 7 with iOS 11.1.2
@SpotifyCares I tried both of those things and nothing works. Restarted phone, logged out/back in, deleted/reinstalled app, reconnected to the WiFi and nothing fixed it. This also seems to be a problem multiple users are having
@SpotifyCares @805318 Same problem here. The app is happily streaming to my Amazon Alexa but I’m unable search or access other tunes from the home page https://t.co/7D0JKzlZeg
@SpotifyCares @805318 Same for my wife and I - phones rebooted and the network connection is spot on (76mbps fibre).
@SpotifyCares @805318 same problem
@SpotifyCares  fixed thanks
@SpotifyCares @805318 Same problem.

iPhone 7 w/ latest iOS
@SpotifyCares @805318 Same issue here with me and my mum, we both have IPhone SE ‘s
@SpotifyCares @805318 Same for me. Defo your end
@SpotifyCares @805318 Same problem (Peru)
@SpotifyCares @805318 Same issue here :(
@SpotifyCares @805318 I'm having the same problem. It's not able to connect but my internet is fine. I'm using an iPhone 7 and I'm running iOS 10.3.3
@SpotifyCares @805318 Same problem
@SpotifyCares Omg you’re awesome thank you 😍🎉🙏🏼
@SpotifyCares @805342 I’m the same on my iPhone X w/ most recent version
@SpotifyCares Listening to music and asking questions. Does Spotify have room for music journalists? ;) Thanks!
@SpotifyCares ow nice. thank u for the reply!
@SpotifyCares @111579 thanks fam this is important
@SpotifyCares Just to follow up on why this is important:

I pay $15/month for a family subscription to Spotify.

These downtimes and glitches happen all the time, at least 5-10 times per month, and are server-side not a connection issue.

Compared to other software I pay for this is not good.
@SpotifyCares Running Android 7 on OnePlus5t, I don't want spotify to act like a wallpaper. Even if i pause a song album artwork still appears. https://t.co/x4D8orYt50
@SpotifyCares @805597 @111579 Same here
@SpotifyCares @805597 @111579 exactly the same issue for me
@SpotifyCares hey , thanks for the reply , everything is working fine now , nice speedy resolution !!! Keep up the good work !!!
@SpotifyCares @805597 @111579 also down for me. Nothing loads except playlists.
@SpotifyCares You guys rock!
@SpotifyCares Thanks For The Info..
I already Signed in..
@SpotifyCares In the web player I’ve been getting a gateway 504 error message. When the page does load none of the music will play.  I’m in chrome on Linux.  On my iPhone none of the search function works I get a blank page for the results.
@SpotifyCares Never mind it's fixed
@SpotifyCares Oh I was just being an arse, ignore me!
@SpotifyCares Thanks guys🤗
@SpotifyCares Yeah it's not working
@SpotifyCares Hahaha was just about to tweet you! Was working perfectly fine for me an hour ago 😅
@SpotifyCares Please do. I’m sad 😔
@SpotifyCares Pls hurry dat ass N fix dis now
@SpotifyCares Make it happen thnx bye
@SpotifyCares Hahah thank you, do you take these suggestions seriously though, be honest haha?
@SpotifyCares All clear of what?
@SpotifyCares @115888 It should be directly after "Houses of the Holy" and I'm slightly distraught right now.
@SpotifyCares Can you let me know when it is back up and running. Thank you
@SpotifyCares Spotify was refusing to work for a long time, but never mind it works again. Thanks
@SpotifyCares Portugal
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Looks like it’s back to normal! Cheers!
@SpotifyCares About time!
@SpotifyCares :D #youRock &lt;3
@SpotifyCares I’ve also restarted my phone, the app and my internet to no avail. And now it looks like the Web Player version is affected too.
@SpotifyCares Seems to be working fine now, thanks!
@SpotifyCares Sweet cheers guys, it actually started working the moment you responded 👌🏾
@SpotifyCares Dying without music here guys... #SpotifyDown
@SpotifyCares @806218 Why am I paying $14.99/month and others are paying $9.99/month? I was given the runaround last time I inquired...
@SpotifyCares Sure - where do I find the email address that I used? I can only find my username. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares #DDoS all our data has been stolen?
@SpotifyCares No it looks like it's back up now☺️
@SpotifyCares Sweet 🙌
@SpotifyCares Great customer service!👍 if there’s any way you can let your product teams know the new play view, such as on Spotify’s ‘mint’ playlist, is awesome... please add the option for this across the app! 😉 https://t.co/IwnieK03Ve
@SpotifyCares Strike that, ALL of the videos after the first one don't work....
@SpotifyCares Works on iPhone but not on desktop or web player!
@SpotifyCares Unfortunately I’m no longer at my work computer, but it was stuck at 0:00 for the videos and a blank screen where the videos should’ve been. If I skipped to the next non-video song it would resume as if nothing happened
@SpotifyCares Hi I'm using an HP 15-ay177cl, working on Windows 10, and I'm just using the most recent version of Spotify for desktop.
@SpotifyCares I've already tried doing this about 5+ times
@SpotifyCares okay dad love you
@SpotifyCares You guys don't have to respect my dumb tweets but thank you very much still
@SpotifyCares My iOS is 11.1.2 and the version is 8.4.28 I deleted it and downloaded again and didn’t seem to work
@SpotifyCares No it’s g thanks x
@SpotifyCares Find that damn culprit and make his/her blood spill!!!🤬 Jk but go awf on them please.
@SpotifyCares Thank you for solving the issue, all good. :)
@SpotifyCares I want you to be aware that neophyte records is misleading release dates regarding neophyte and nosferatu
@SpotifyCares Everything eh okay
@SpotifyCares IPhone was having issue
@SpotifyCares Asking for a friend lmAoo
@SpotifyCares Okay! Thanks 🙏🏼
@SpotifyCares Works like a charm. You guys rock. I am, of course, a premium subscriber!
@SpotifyCares I have been logged out of my account. Received an email telling me my email had changed and I never asked to change it. Help please!
@SpotifyCares Holy shit you guys answered lmao thank you! Appreciate ya. ❤️🎵
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the update. I understand, I was just frustrated.
@SpotifyCares ok thanks
@SpotifyCares That doesnt fix, it has been doing it on the web version and the app for awhile. The ad lengths are random but this is the longest ive seen.
@SpotifyCares I have reinstalled but I am still getting very long ads
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply!
@SpotifyCares :( https://t.co/dI6iM4Kfy3
@SpotifyCares I finally can search again its ok now. Ty tkt tous answer
@SpotifyCares @806617 You should integrate Musixmatch into Spotify like Snapchat did with Shazam.
@SpotifyCares Nope all good now! Thanks a bunch!
@SpotifyCares Haha thanks 😁
@SpotifyCares All good now!
@SpotifyCares Thank for checking in and responding guys! Really appreciate it!
@SpotifyCares Thank you, it seems to be working now
@SpotifyCares Looks great. Thanks! I just wanted some Sufjan 😭
@SpotifyCares up and running again
@SpotifyCares Yeah I noticed lol thanks 👍
@SpotifyCares Still no lyrics!. 😕
@SpotifyCares Thx guys !
@SpotifyCares no it’s all good! i kinda just left it alone for an hour and it fixed itself!
@SpotifyCares It’s been over a year since Lemonade came out. No more “looking into it”  🍋
@SpotifyCares Ok thanks I was just messing
@SpotifyCares HURRY YO ASSES UP I NEED MY MUSIC 😭
@SpotifyCares all set thx
@SpotifyCares Yeah, continually saying I'm offline, or just saying error whenever I try to load a page
@SpotifyCares Both data and wifi having issues, it's an iPhone 5s running the latest iOS and Spotify was just updated a week or two ago
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/xxk4LOoy04
@SpotifyCares Downloaded songs are working fine but I can’t browse 🙄
@SpotifyCares No, it seems to be ok now.  Ty
@SpotifyCares It’s working now! Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thank you. Love your service. It's all I use!!!
@SpotifyCares @806947 Way to take credit for my save AR
@SpotifyCares Are you guys looking to implement a setting where you can choose the order of playlists, rather than editing the current tracks and having it reset?
@SpotifyCares So I go to that and select "custom" but it doesn't give me an option to customize it. Does that have to do with me not having premium at the moment? I was having issues with payment and I'm fixing them at the moment. Nothing to worry about there.
@SpotifyCares THANK YOUUUU
@SpotifyCares false alarm! it's fixed now
@SpotifyCares Spotify web player is still not working for me, my playlist will open and the songs show in a list but I cannot get it to play
@SpotifyCares Yeah it came back up thank you
@SpotifyCares You really do care - not just a name 👏
@SpotifyCares Thank you! It's good now
@SpotifyCares If this was a custom response with the "backstage" because I talked about showtunes, you really broke a leg here 👏🙌
@SpotifyCares Yep all good, thank you
@SpotifyCares Yes all working
@SpotifyCares Cool. Do you ever compensate customers for their lost access during glitches and bug outs? Because I pay for premium access and am frustrated by your service several times every week.
@SpotifyCares I have no indication that any of my accounts have been compromised. I'm actually referring to this issue, which seems to date back to 2015 and is still being reported: https://t.co/VmaZKbMwiq
@SpotifyCares Alright, thanks for the response
@SpotifyCares No issues now. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the link but obviously I am aware the playlist function is not on the Roku app. Please make your Roku app better. It’s terrible.
@SpotifyCares Everything is back to normal. Thank you, have a great night and happy holidays!
@SpotifyCares Back working. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Working again 🤗😽
@SpotifyCares All good here. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Indeed it works. Thanks. 😌
@SpotifyCares Looks like it may be sorted now, lads. 👌
@SpotifyCares It works again thanks guys but I think I deserve free membership for the trauma
@SpotifyCares Both on the android app. I've upgraded apps, upgraded phones. I've avoided using battery saving mode, I did everything you guys respond with but it's a faulty app idk what to say
@SpotifyCares God bless
@SpotifyCares @807627 How do I unlink a deleted Facebook account, it just keeps showing up...
@SpotifyCares Thank you it's working now:)
@SpotifyCares Works again thanks for the fix
@SpotifyCares I'm chatting to an agent right now, thanks :)

@SpotifyCares No more issues here thanks
@SpotifyCares Cheers.
@SpotifyCares thank you @115888 i love u

@SpotifyCares Nah - thank you for getting back to me regardless 👌🏻👍🏻
@SpotifyCares Yeah - it came back online just as I was leaving the gym! #quietsession
@SpotifyCares I literally pay for Spotify for this new album wtf I’ve been u guys for 2 years but ok cool🖕🏼
@SpotifyCares This isn’t what I need :-))))
@SpotifyCares Dumb
@SpotifyCares Nope I purposely deleted it bc no one is helpful. Isk why I pay for your services
@SpotifyCares I’m unsubscribing and going back to Apple Music.
@SpotifyCares @1534 HI IM OFFENDED
@SpotifyCares Thank you so much!
@SpotifyCares Certain songs are blocking Spotify from working on Mobile, and Google Devices. Example Christmas remix 2014
@SpotifyCares Thanks NQ! 'Radio' wasn't working, but 'Daily Mix' is functioning as expected. Thanks fir the follow up.
@SpotifyCares Radio us working as expected! 📻📻📻
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply but the reason it wasn't used much is because not many people knew about it maybe u should have advertised it cos I only accidentally found it a while back
@SpotifyCares Thanks g
@SpotifyCares i’m sorry guys it’s working now :)
@SpotifyCares yea we back up this bih i almost pulled up to yall with a draco
@SpotifyCares It's fine thanks
@SpotifyCares All set!
@SpotifyCares Aye it's working now. Sorry for being bitchy, I get cranky without music. Thx 💚
@SpotifyCares Thanks guys!
@SpotifyCares Thank you! 💛 my Spotify!
@SpotifyCares Thank you. It‘s working again 🙏!
@SpotifyCares It’s all good now thanks
@SpotifyCares thanks!
@SpotifyCares PC, Windows 10, v. 1.0.68.407
@SpotifyCares Seems to be working so far but I'll send the info anyway in case there's anything logged info that can help if others experience the same problem.
@SpotifyCares It's all fixed! Thanks so much!
@SpotifyCares Thanks for making my life a lot easier! I was nervous when I realized I might not have my handy playlist for my six-year-olds tomorrow :-P I can't sing the Clean Up song by myself! I need my chilled out tunes for after work as well! Cheers. Cc: @808371
@SpotifyCares Thank you!!!! So happy to have ya back
@SpotifyCares All good thanks!
@SpotifyCares Appreciate it. It just happened to correspond with exactly when we sent an email blast announcing our record release😮
@SpotifyCares Wow you guys have such fast turnaround! I listen to Spotify on my way to and from work, on and off at work, and at the gym (when I decide I'm not being lazy that day) - 85% of the time it's Shawn Mendes. If I up it to 90%, can we agree I'm a huge fan in Spotify's eyes (😉)?
@SpotifyCares yup. Good now. Thanks.
@SpotifyCares @147836 Guys, we waiting that since 3 years seriously... 😐
@SpotifyCares i tried adding local files but couldn't find the button. is this feature only available for US residents? https://t.co/mhdJzHuoOC
@SpotifyCares The music videos in the playlists now.
@SpotifyCares On iOS 11.  Can you add a setting that you can turn off videos please.  I don’t need MTV or YouTube just streaming mp3 music.
@SpotifyCares Thanks Spotify. As if I ever doubted you for a moment!
@SpotifyCares Nothing is really “happening,” I just don’t feel like it’s a well-designed tablet app. It’s just a big phone app. The desktop interface would fit the iPad Pro much better.
@SpotifyCares It worked right when they said “turn off your phone” so I was able to download a few songs. Thx for checking!
@SpotifyCares Is it possible to extend the play history?
@SpotifyCares Kinda like YouTube history, songs you listen to will appear in a list. It doesn't have to be forever, just like the past 2 weeks or something.
@SpotifyCares It's working now. Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Sure. Hang on a second
@SpotifyCares I did as you said and it is still the same. Another screenshot after logging out, restarting and logging back in. https://t.co/sreELDdkQF
@SpotifyCares Done!
@SpotifyCares Sure. 11.1.2 and here is a screenshot to hopefully help. https://t.co/F2SEftD17y
@SpotifyCares Ver. 8.4.28.875 armV7
@SpotifyCares Same goes in the Assistant settings page. https://t.co/aEUGoSN26h
@SpotifyCares Will do. Thank you.
@SpotifyCares Thanks! It did help.
@SpotifyCares Most of the ads are too loud, significantly louder than music is. It's on all platforms and devices. Need to implement some kind of avg loudness req
@SpotifyCares Android version?
@SpotifyCares It forces me to buy, i cannot.
No like.
@SpotifyCares Galaxy s5
@SpotifyCares @112253   it says not available in offline mode ... its never done this before
@SpotifyCares Been there, done that.

Your move, Spotify.

PS. We really like your service!
@SpotifyCares Also, I have a persistent issue with the offline songs for my singular devicr for Android. Cache acting up again, need to re-sync all he whole 900+ songs that I have which is a total pain. Everybody has had this issue and you know it.
@SpotifyCares Thank you!
@SpotifyCares Yes
@SpotifyCares I use chrome, though, Internet explorer works https://t.co/vsVEzNMm37
@SpotifyCares Incognito does work. I have not made any changes to my browser
@SpotifyCares Still doesn’t work
@SpotifyCares Thanks fam
@SpotifyCares OK cuz:
Baby, It's Cold Outside - Zooey Deschanel &amp; Lawrence Redbone is the best version of the song, along with My Grown Up Christmas List - Kelly Clarkson
Also: Chivas - Kelly Clarkson
😀💚
@SpotifyCares also the lyrics function coming back
@SpotifyCares Iphone 6plus, 11.1.1 ios
@SpotifyCares Yes thank you! Kinda wish you could choose to see history of song or view full lyrics. But the @19199 works best I guess. TY!
@SpotifyCares Hi, i’m using an IMac (mid 2011 version) with macOS High Sierra and Spotify version 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf
@SpotifyCares I did but now the loading of an album after selecting it takes forever (same for selecting a playlist etc...) I keep seeing the loading circle already 5mins now
@SpotifyCares No on my IPhone the app works flawless
@SpotifyCares Real Artist in Track:
https://t.co/Nsy4zoqMYl 

Artist Track is Currently Attributed to:

Song Link:
https://t.co/nXF0q3L2Vp
@SpotifyCares @7443
@SpotifyCares Yep. All that I tried. Even uninstalled, restarted. Removed all data by hand. Installed again. The default settings was set to SD card, but all music ended on the internal storage.
@SpotifyCares Yes, the option is there. I tried to switch there and back. Spotify restarted each time, but the songs were always "moved" to internal storage.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the feedback, appreciate it
@SpotifyCares That's to bad. Thanks for the info.
@SpotifyCares Oooppss my bad, yeah, i’ll share you the screencap via DM
@SpotifyCares Please get this fixed ASAP... the real Logic deserves credit, thank you for responding. ✌🏻
@SpotifyCares .
@SpotifyCares I think I replied on accident, but do you have knowledge on whether reputation by Taylor Swift will be available for streaming this coming friday
@SpotifyCares When reputation by taylor swift wil be out on spotify
@SpotifyCares No prob! It works now. Apparently, I was not the only person in Spain that had issues with the connection, but they all seem solved now. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I don’t have a link but I have a screenshot! It’s on this ad! Please help me! I need this song in my life! @SpotifyCares https://t.co/0iR0wZ1juw
@SpotifyCares Im in Dubai right now, but my Apple ID is american,,, and yes i'm trying to create a spotify account ,
@SpotifyCares Is there a way I can stop Spotify from making a radio for every single thing that I play? Like I'll go to click on my playlist and I'm like wait this isn't on my playlist. And then I realise oh shit fam it's a radio
@SpotifyCares I’m on free because premium cost money and like I listen to a playlist with numerous artists and then it creates a radio for it which confuses me because I don’t read which one is which.
@SpotifyCares Okay yep sorry but I explained myself poorly. After listening to a playlist it will create a radio for that playlist. That radio plays other artists and tracks. So I’m wondering if I can delete those radios. I hope that’s better
@SpotifyCares Thank you for putting with me but that’s not quite the problem I have. Okay so see how there is 2 playlists called “under” well 1 of those is a radio. Now I can’t delete the radio the same way I can delete my playlist. So how do I delete it? https://t.co/3RSNdvdb29
@SpotifyCares Thanks!

I hope your team decides to make Electronic/Dance more diverse rather than relegating gay music to privately shared playlists.
@SpotifyCares Yea as we don't have Spotify India and you guys might launch it soon , so I thought of ..... https://t.co/lbWr4XjXuh
@SpotifyCares Nevermind it works again 😇
@SpotifyCares @147836 India has over a billion music lovers n it’s a mystery why a company as great as @115888 hasn’t started biz in India? 😐😐
@SpotifyCares Yay! iPhone 6. Device OS 11.2 Public beta 5. Spotify version 8.4.28.1104. Thanks for caring! 🙌
@SpotifyCares 😮🤦🏻‍♀️Sweeet! Thanks for the help!
@SpotifyCares A think, a few more LP tracks, I think almost all the tracks I've played when I was using the Spotify Basic.
@SpotifyCares Yes, maybe you can help here:

Can you confirm if Christmas songs reentering the charts due to increased seasonal streams are subject to the 1:300 'accelerated chart ratio' having already charted for a number of years, or has a 'manual reset' been authorised?
@SpotifyCares @SpotifyCares i cant get the P9 premium. I am getting this error. Just to let you know this is the first time i try to get a premium and i did not get a free trial at all! https://t.co/1WDRNylPp1
@SpotifyCares I love you, @SpotifyCares . It’s so good to be back. 😍
@SpotifyCares Yea. I know. I just need to keep pushing!
@SpotifyCares I've already taken these steps  I have reinstalled having cleared offline devices, I am online every day, I have not got more than 3 devices downloaded and I am not over the song limit. My app is up to date, but the songs will clear without an update happening.
@SpotifyCares It has happened again this morning, having downloaded all songs again Yesterday, and this morning my songs and albums list was 'empty' despite closing and opening the app and restarting the phone.
@SpotifyCares Attached: definition of the term Advertisement. This qualifies as an advertisement, and yet you still did not answer my question. Advertisements should be opt-in, not opt-out for premium users. https://t.co/PKKzibXRPV
@SpotifyCares Cheers chaps!
@SpotifyCares I'm referring to Discover Weekly. I _do_ listen to Finnish metal, but not Finnish pop.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I've been doing that for months if not years now :-) I guess my taste is music is hard to categorize ;-)
@SpotifyCares You're welcome, not today.  Enjoy your day.
@SpotifyCares Thanks in advance for your time! :-)
@SpotifyCares Bluetooth is desactivated. And nobody else is on my wifi network.
Maybe a bug on your side ?
@SpotifyCares Allright, so you charged me double the amount of my subscription while I only have 1 family account
@SpotifyCares Sorry. Today's problem was with Google Play Music. I was just comparing the experience to what you guys did to me a few years ago.
@SpotifyCares I fixed it, twitter updated itself and turned on video auto play turned it off and it stopped
@SpotifyCares Spotify version 8.4.28.1104 IOS version 11.0.3 (IPhone 6)
@SpotifyCares Yes, at random moments
@SpotifyCares Is DM alright?
@SpotifyCares So i was updating my iPhone when you responded and I guess that’s what it was. It was 1 version behind. I am so sorry for wasting your time!!
@SpotifyCares Yep, someone on support chat got me my account back. Thanks guys!
@SpotifyCares So mean!
@SpotifyCares No, there's nothing else I want. I just want to use Spotify here.
@SpotifyCares No, I was saying that I noticed that it's now a feature when I play my Discover list and just wanted to let you know I appreciate it!
@SpotifyCares __email__ &lt;= my email address
@SpotifyCares Samsung Galaxy S5 neo, Android 6.0.1, Spotify 8.4.26.770 armv7
Whenever i select a song to play on my chromecast and let spotify run in the background of my phone, after the song ends, it  starts playing from the beginning of the playlist instead of next song
@SpotifyCares Nope did not, tried to re init by reloading spotify and preload the playlist before casting, didnt help
@SpotifyCares thefuck, now it seems to work fine... and i replicated it 2 times... I still think it has to do with preloading, sice that has always been an issue with spotify, as well as on pc as phone
@SpotifyCares Restarted my phone. It has since been restored 👏🏾👍
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6s, iOS 11.1, and just updated to the newest Spotify. Still crashing
@SpotifyCares Device: iPhone 5s
iOS: latest 11.1.2
@SpotifyCares hurry lads!
@SpotifyCares you fixed it very quick but my some of my new playsist aren't always showing up since my account was hacked, they are their but they take some time to show up.
@SpotifyCares I already checked with support and I secured my account but it's acting weird now
@SpotifyCares iPhone 6S, iOS 11.1.2, and Spotify is up to date.
@SpotifyCares No it was this band &gt;&gt;&gt; @29781 Im in the US. They released a new song, true colors, and its not on spotify anymore.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/wIxvrZ4p9O
@SpotifyCares Thanks, I’ve voted but would really like to see this feature updated regularly. It’s really helpful but it’s getting very repetitive now. Not good for long distance runs.
@SpotifyCares um, poor algorithmic music selection?
@SpotifyCares I noticed it most on the Browse screen under Discover - which has stopped working at all for me now (nothing appears when i click there now). just thought it was funny what the algorithm thought I'd want to "discover" and how far off it was.
@SpotifyCares Well, about newly released songs/albums. For what would I follow them then? And why there are settings on https://t.co/QgzHN7Wlnj when I get exactly zero notifications?
@SpotifyCares I have email notifications on for longer time and still no updates.
@SpotifyCares Ok! That's a lotta work... it will take me a few.
@SpotifyCares Just Closed the App and Opened it again. Everything's working fine now, I'm completely back to streaming at 1am instead of sleeping 😄
@SpotifyCares I appreciate the help very much, https://t.co/JOCm3PKYOM
@SpotifyCares I deleted Spotify and downloaded it again but it's still doing the same thing
@SpotifyCares can you add the song "push it to the limit" by Paul Engemann again?
@SpotifyCares Dang. That is smooth.
@SpotifyCares I've done all this before. It stops temporarily and then out of nowhere happens again. I keep having to uninstall and download everything again. It's a bit of a pathetic product I'm paying for having to do that all the time.
@SpotifyCares Im am. It said presale starts tomm
@SpotifyCares samsung galaxy s6
@SpotifyCares Didn't work, I reinstaled it, but still the same
@SpotifyCares I will dm you!
@SpotifyCares yeah it was suggested in 2013 and made a "Good Idea" in 2015 https://t.co/LhWZ7oZ2ID
@SpotifyCares Roughly 2000
@SpotifyCares Yep - it's this one - https://t.co/ZgRVYHvqlx :)
@SpotifyCares Thanks - it came back, thank God!  :-) Maybe I didn't wait long enough for refresh.
@SpotifyCares I tried w/ a different browser, but I can't, not sure what's wrong. This is all what I get using the website. I like to share the artwork w/ Spotify code on my social media, I don't think I'm sharing again until you guys solve this ;( https://t.co/4ef4QX6i48
@SpotifyCares Thanks! Would love if they could extend it to 2 hours or more.  The current playlist is around 35 minutes which lasts for approximately a 4-mile run
@SpotifyCares Yes, I have tried everything. Using an American iPad helps but I cannot carry an iPad just to listen some music. European devices already have lower dynamics, but recently Spotify took it to a whole new level. BTW I'm using 32 Ohm headphones.
@SpotifyCares Everything is working now thanks for the help!  #greatcustomerservice
@SpotifyCares Frequently upon startup - Spotify plays song at high rate of speed. But pause, and then play and all is well. Annoying
@SpotifyCares iPhone 8, iOS 11.1.1, 8.4.25.906
@SpotifyCares No error messages
@SpotifyCares That’s great. Thanks for letting me know.
@SpotifyCares I can't get a private message to work.
@SpotifyCares Finally found it. There was a comment box over the response area that needed to be closed to see where to respond.  Message sent. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares Nvm it is him, carry on
@SpotifyCares this is really freakin me out...
@SpotifyCares Thanks for letting me know! Is there a reason that full lyrics aren’t made accessible to all listeners like it was a few years ago?
@SpotifyCares Oh I definitely will!
@SpotifyCares Okay thank you!!!💖💖💖
@SpotifyCares i contacted customer support, i was just lamenting. but i am very satisfied with how ya'll handle issues. so thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thank you I’ll have a look
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/vkISxZyloZ
@SpotifyCares All set. Thanks :)
@SpotifyCares It’s up and working! Thanks guys!
@SpotifyCares Computer says no. I guess I'll just log in with my own details.
@SpotifyCares I think its version 8.4. The funny thing is that if I don't click on the app and just listen to my music normally on my phone it all shows up on the watch normally when I slide up. My plays lists and everything is there. So I guess it works? https://t.co/ASlO63JP9n
@SpotifyCares Yea it's weird that if I don't attempt to open the app it works when I start it up from my phone. I guess I can't listen through the phone which is what the app is for? It's fine. I can control the music anyway. Just super confusing at first. Thanks for responding.
@SpotifyCares Hi, whenever I listen to the desktop app on my Dell/Windows computer through headphones, there’s really bad static starting almost exactly at noon Monday through Wednesday and it’s a problem throughout my office; it’s also staticky through the website player if there’s a diff.
@SpotifyCares Headphones work fine on all other devices and desktop player of this computer works fine w/o headphones.
@SpotifyCares yes, same static issue :/
@SpotifyCares &amp; This is why I still ♥ @115888 lol
@SpotifyCares Appreciate the quick response, Team! I'll give those steps a try and report back.
@SpotifyCares Thanks. I'm referring to the new like (heart)/don't like btns I'm now seeing on my discover weekly playlist in the Mac app. Seems like btn adds songs to my library now? Or? Thanks!
@SpotifyCares I️ do have a subscription but can’t use it at work because it logs in through Facebook.
@SpotifyCares why wont you remove racist songs?
@SpotifyCares So sad 💔 Im from Argentina 😭 @7352
@SpotifyCares Yes I understand there is a limit, but why?
@SpotifyCares It's been over 1 year and there is still a limit of 10,000 songs. Are there any plans to change this? I literally have to delete songs every single day to add new ones. Plz plz help
@SpotifyCares Oh, so he must not be in the US because her app hasn’t been released here yet.  So, it has to be either New Zealand, Singapore, Brazil or Canada.
@SpotifyCares ok, thanks. he said let’s start a petition and I said to myself, no that’s not how you go about it and that’s when I tweeted you. I’ll pass along the info to him. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares @113729 Specifically his older material! "Devin Townsend" &amp; "Devin Townsend Band". Please come back soon :(
@SpotifyCares Sounds good thanks! The rest of his music seems to be available. It will do for now!
@SpotifyCares i did both but nope :(((
@SpotifyCares I'm not really getting any error messages, it just won't let me play anything https://t.co/gG6uDgQTRx
@SpotifyCares its private wifi. it works on the app on a desktop computer but the web player still won't play anything
@SpotifyCares its fixed now! thanks for trying to help!
@SpotifyCares I use a Samsung note 5 and 8.4.29.289
@SpotifyCares I've never logged into any other device so I don't know
@SpotifyCares Yes I just did and now it won't play any music or connect to my WiFi
@SpotifyCares I also Uninstalled and reinstalled the app this morning which didn't help
@SpotifyCares Nope.
@SpotifyCares OS X Yosemite Version 10.10.5 and Spotify version 1.0.68.407.g6864aaaf if that makes any sense?
@SpotifyCares Once I bought it the app kept skipping through songs and not playing anything but it stops and plays 7 commercials in a row and the skips through every song again.
@SpotifyCares iPhone X. iOS 11.2. Latest Spotify version
@SpotifyCares That’s the problem. I have to do that EVERY time. Not cool!
@SpotifyCares Well hopefully you get it back sooner than later.
@SpotifyCares Dell Precision 3420
Using Spotify on web browser
Mozilla Firefox 57.0
@SpotifyCares Same thing on Chrome. My guess is you received a different master of the album; that I'm not used to hearing. I'm used to the first three songs ending into one another and not fading out.
@SpotifyCares Thanks for the reply! 🔥🎶
@SpotifyCares Nahhhh This is what I meant.    https://t.co/A70HW3EtGI

@SpotifyCares Done.  Thanks in advance!
@SpotifyCares first off, you are very late. i messaged you over an 30 minuets ago; very disappointing.   anyways, my question is how did the picture change? is this some sort of secret witchcraft you have? i need answers &amp; i need them now!
@SpotifyCares 3 places, S6 Edge+ with latest update, on a Win10 machine and on Macbook Air. None of them works even on any browser. I get the error below but when I try to resolve it I get the same error. https://t.co/29Tf8uRPAj
@SpotifyCares If this actually happens, please let me know ❤️ I love you more than you can ever know
@SpotifyCares That worked, thank you!
@SpotifyCares Thank you
@SpotifyCares @115888 wellll... I also noticed that the Anastasia soundtrack is also missing 😬
@SpotifyCares much obliged
@SpotifyCares Yeah actually that was the last thing I just tried. It's been like this for a few weeks.
@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/naZQMgzthi
@SpotifyCares Oh sorry, i didn't express me very well. Please, look out the bio of the playlist in the  picture. it has a "shortcut" to another playlist "Top Alternativo". I wanna know if a can do that, and how. Thank you so much.

@SpotifyCares @3537 @3212 @328645 @234 Thank you 😂
@SpotifyCares Oh wasn’t expecting a reply lol. Thanks for the reply but I was only able to keep it when I was using the 4.99 a month plan. Thanks again. Hope you have a great night!
@SpotifyCares Will do. Please let me know if you start any deals for teacher :)
@SpotifyCares No it is NOT.  My issue still persist and I have been charged a 3rd F'ing time.   I followed the student verification as well.
@SpotifyCares Yes please! Last year’s playlist is so much fun to look back on.
@SpotifyCares It’s cool. It started working like a half hour later (no resets necessary). Bizarre but whatever. Thanks!
@SpotifyCares This is when i tried to install the app on my computor https://t.co/QWh9QLpLHU
@SpotifyCares Thank you ❤️

@SpotifyCares Dear Mr/Ms, already 2 day i'm try to register a new account but can't, why? please help me and thank you.
@SpotifyCares it's Chrome, it's been happening randomly and frequently, let's say it crashed almost everyday. thanks for reply x

@SpotifyCares Ended up getting confused and paying for an extra premium subscription. I’d like to cancel but I can’t log on.
@SpotifyCares I do have a question, why would you remove it because there was still an engagement rate even if it was low?!
@SpotifyCares iphone 7 and the latest spotify update
@SpotifyCares spotify 8.4.28 ios 11.1
@SpotifyCares I updated my app and now there's no place for me to find what songs I've saved. It's all playlists
@SpotifyCares I haven't recently played any of this. And the song on the bottom isn't mine either. All I want is to get to what I've saved. https://t.co/3JFWjJingf
@SpotifyCares cool! your speediness and efforts are much appreciated!
@SpotifyCares Welp okay
@SpotifyCares Dude, you said 4990, but its charged me 49990, like wtf
@SpotifyCares Yep, this still doesn’t help my situation
@SpotifyCares No on the shuffle of the band
@SpotifyCares Thank you for the response!
@SpotifyCares “going off” meaning playing the good songs
@SpotifyCares Thank you :*
@SpotifyCares Fb Error reads “there is an error logging into your application. Try again later”
@SpotifyCares Well, I’m a premium member of Spotify because it’s 200% worth it, and I’ve been getting adds recently... is that new?
@SpotifyCares Simple restart of my phone seems to have fixed it but it's cleared all my offline music?
